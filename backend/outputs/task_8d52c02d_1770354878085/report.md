- 零冠词：复数名词和不可数名词泛指、球类运动、三餐、学科等

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I have a umbrella.~~ → ✅ **I have an umbrella.** (umbrella以元音音素开头，用an)
- ❌ ~~He is an university student.~~ → ✅ **He is a university student.** (university虽以u开头，但发音是辅音/ju:/，用a)
- ❌ ~~I like playing the football.~~ → ✅ **I like playing football.** (球类运动前不加冠词)

**📌 例句：**
- I saw a dog. The dog was very cute.

- 各种时态的被动：is done, was done, will be done, has been done等

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~The car was repair yesterday.~~ → ✅ **The car was repaired yesterday.** (be后面要用动词的过去分词)

- 比较级的修饰词：much, a lot, even, still, a little

**📌 例句：**

# 📖 语法

## 1. 不定式 (to + 动词原形)

**📝 定义：** 由to + 动词原形构成的非谓语动词形式，可以作主语、宾语、表语、定语、状语和宾语补足语。

**📋 结构：** to + 动词原形

**💡 用法：**
- 作宾语：I want to go home. / I decide to study hard.
- 作目的状语：I came here to see you.
- 作主语：To learn English well is important. = It is important to learn English well.
- 作宾语补足语：My mother asked me to clean the room.
- 作定语：I have something to tell you.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I want go home.~~ → ✅ **I want to go home.** (want后接不定式，必须有to)
- ❌ ~~He made me to cry.~~ → ✅ **He made me cry.** (make/let/have等使役动词后用省略to的不定式)
- ❌ ~~I saw him to run.~~ → ✅ **I saw him run/running.** (感官动词see/hear/watch后用省略to的不定式或-ing)

**📌 例句：**
- She decided to become a doctor.
- It's kind of you to help me.
- I don't know what to do.

## 2. 一般现在时

**📝 定义：** 表示经常性、习惯性的动作或状态，也用于表示客观事实、真理和现在的状态。

**📋 结构：** 主语 + 动词原形（第三人称单数加-s/-es）

**💡 用法：**
- 表示经常性或习惯性动作：I get up at 6 every day.
- 表示客观事实或真理：The earth goes around the sun.
- 表示现在的状态或特征：She looks beautiful.
- 在时间/条件状语从句中表将来：If it rains tomorrow, I will stay at home.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~He go to school every day.~~ → ✅ **He goes to school every day.** (第三人称单数主语后，动词要加-s或-es)
- ❌ ~~She don't like apples.~~ → ✅ **She doesn't like apples.** (第三人称单数的否定用doesn't，不用don't)

**📌 例句：**
- I usually have breakfast at 7:00.
- She speaks English very well.
- Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius.

## 3. 一般过去时

**📝 定义：** 表示过去某一时间发生的动作或存在的状态，也表示过去经常或反复发生的动作。

**📋 结构：** 主语 + 动词过去式（be动词用was/were）

**💡 用法：**
- 表示过去发生的动作：I visited my grandma yesterday.
- 表示过去存在的状态：He was a teacher ten years ago.
- 表示过去的习惯：When I was young, I often played football.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I go to Beijing last year.~~ → ✅ **I went to Beijing last year.** (有过去时间标志词（last year），动词要用过去式)
- ❌ ~~Did you went there?~~ → ✅ **Did you go there?** (did后面的动词要用原形)

**📌 例句：**
- She bought a new dress yesterday.
- They were happy at the party.
- I didn't watch TV last night.

## 4. 现在完成时

**📝 定义：** 表示过去发生的动作对现在造成的影响或结果，也表示从过去持续到现在的动作或状态。

**📋 结构：** 主语 + have/has + 过去分词

**💡 用法：**
- 表示过去的动作对现在的影响：I have lost my key. (现在没有钥匙)
- 表示经历：Have you ever been to Beijing?
- 表示持续到现在的状态：I have lived here for 10 years.
- 常与already, yet, just, ever, never, for, since连用

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I have see the movie.~~ → ✅ **I have seen the movie.** (have/has后面要用动词的过去分词形式)
- ❌ ~~I have bought this book yesterday.~~ → ✅ **I bought this book yesterday.** (有具体过去时间（yesterday），不能用现在完成时)
- ❌ ~~He has gone to Beijing for 3 days.~~ → ✅ **He has been in Beijing for 3 days.** (have gone表示去了还没回来，不能与for连用)

**📌 例句：**
- She has already finished her homework.
- I have never met him before.
- We have known each other since 2020.

## 5. 被动语态

**📝 定义：** 当主语是动作的承受者时，使用被动语态。强调动作的承受者或动作本身。

**📋 结构：** 主语 + be + 过去分词 + (by + 动作执行者)

**💡 用法：**
- 不知道或不必说明动作执行者：The window was broken.
- 强调动作承受者：The book was written by Lu Xun.
- 客观报道或正式场合：The meeting will be held tomorrow.
- 各种时态的被动：is done, was done, will be done, has been done等

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~The car was repair yesterday.~~ → ✅ **The car was repaired yesterday.** (be后面要用动词的过去分词)
- ❌ ~~The book is belonged to me.~~ → ✅ **The book belongs to me.** (belong是不及物动词，没有被动语态)

**📌 例句：**
- English is spoken all over the world.
- The bridge was built in 1990.
- The work must be finished on time.

## 6. 宾语从句

**📝 定义：** 在复合句中作宾语的从句，通常放在主句谓语动词、介词或形容词之后。

**📋 结构：** 主句 + 引导词(that/wh-/if/whether) + 陈述语序

**💡 用法：**
- that引导（可省略）：I think (that) he is right.
- wh-词引导：I don't know what his name is.
- if/whether引导：I wonder if/whether he will come.
- 注意宾语从句要用陈述语序

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I don't know where is he.~~ → ✅ **I don't know where he is.** (宾语从句要用陈述语序，不用疑问语序)
- ❌ ~~He asked me that where I lived.~~ → ✅ **He asked me where I lived.** (特殊疑问词引导时不需要that)
- ❌ ~~I wonder if will he come.~~ → ✅ **I wonder if he will come.** (if引导的宾语从句要用陈述语序)

**📌 例句：**
- I believe that you can do it.
- Could you tell me how I can get to the station?
- I'm not sure whether it will rain tomorrow.

## 7. 定语从句

**📝 定义：** 在复合句中修饰名词或代词的从句，通常紧跟在被修饰的词（先行词）之后。

**📋 结构：** 先行词 + 关系词(who/which/that/whose/where/when) + 从句

**💡 用法：**
- who/that指人：The man who/that is talking is my father.
- which/that指物：The book which/that I bought is interesting.
- whose表所属：The girl whose mother is a doctor is my friend.
- where指地点：This is the school where I studied.
- when指时间：I still remember the day when I met you.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~The man which is talking is my teacher.~~ → ✅ **The man who/that is talking is my teacher.** (先行词是人时，用who或that，不用which)
- ❌ ~~The book who I bought is good.~~ → ✅ **The book which/that I bought is good.** (先行词是物时，用which或that，不用who)
- ❌ ~~This is the place where I visited.~~ → ✅ **This is the place which/that I visited.** (visit是及物动词，需要宾语，用which/that而非where)

**📌 例句：**
- I have a friend who can speak five languages.
- The movie that we saw last night was exciting.
- I'll never forget the day when I graduated.

## 8. 选择疑问句

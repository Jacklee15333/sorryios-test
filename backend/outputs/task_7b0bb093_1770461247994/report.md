# 📖 语法

## 1. 现在完成时

**📝 定义：** 表示过去发生的动作对现在造成的影响或结果，也表示从过去持续到现在的动作或状态。

**📋 结构：** 主语 + have/has + 过去分词

**💡 用法：**
- 表示过去的动作对现在的影响：I have lost my key. (现在没有钥匙)
- 表示经历：Have you ever been to Beijing?
- 表示持续到现在的状态：I have lived here for 10 years.
- 常与already, yet, just, ever, never, for, since连用

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I have see the movie.~~ → ✅ **I have seen the movie.** (have/has后面要用动词的过去分词形式)
- ❌ ~~I have bought this book yesterday.~~ → ✅ **I bought this book yesterday.** (有具体过去时间（yesterday），不能用现在完成时)
- ❌ ~~He has gone to Beijing for 3 days.~~ → ✅ **He has been in Beijing for 3 days.** (have gone表示去了还没回来，不能与for连用)

**📌 例句：**
- She has already finished her homework.
- I have never met him before.
- We have known each other since 2020.

## 2. 常用介词

**📝 定义：** 用在名词、代词或动名词前，表示时间、地点、方式、原因等关系的词。

- 时间：at+时刻, on+具体日期, in+年月季节长时段
- 地点：at+小地点, in+大地点/里面, on+表面
- 方式：by+交通工具/方式, with+工具/材料, in+语言/颜色
- 常见搭配：be good at, be interested in, look for, wait for, listen to

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I arrived at Beijing.~~ → ✅ **I arrived in Beijing.** (arrive in+大地点，arrive at+小地点)
- ❌ ~~I go to school by a bus.~~ → ✅ **I go to school by bus.** (by+交通工具中间不加冠词)
- ❌ ~~I'm looking forward to see you.~~ → ✅ **I'm looking forward to seeing you.** (look forward to后面接动名词)

- 多音节和部分双音节词：more + 原级（beautiful→more beautiful）
- 不规则变化：good/well→better, bad/badly→worse, many/much→more
- 比较级的修饰词：much, a lot, even, still, a little

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~She is more taller than me.~~ → ✅ **She is taller than me.** (tall是单音节词，用-er形式，不需要more)
- ❌ ~~He runs more fast than me.~~ → ✅ **He runs faster than me.** (fast的比较级是faster，不是more fast)
- ❌ ~~This book is more better.~~ → ✅ **This book is better / much better.** (good的比较级是better，不能用more修饰)

- 表示过去存在的状态：He was a teacher ten years ago.
- 表示过去的习惯：When I was young, I often played football.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I go to Beijing last year.~~ → ✅ **I went to Beijing last year.** (有过去时间标志词（last year），动词要用过去式)

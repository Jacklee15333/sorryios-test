# 📖 语法

## 1. 现在完成时

**📝 定义：** 表示过去发生的动作对现在造成的影响或结果，也表示从过去持续到现在的动作或状态。

**📋 结构：** 主语 + have/has + 过去分词

**💡 用法：**
- 表示过去的动作对现在的影响：I have lost my key. (现在没有钥匙)
- 表示经历：Have you ever been to Beijing?
- 表示持续到现在的状态：I have lived here for 10 years.
- 常与already, yet, just, ever, never, for, since连用

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I have see the movie.~~ → ✅ **I have seen the movie.** (have/has后面要用动词的过去分词形式)
- ❌ ~~I have bought this book yesterday.~~ → ✅ **I bought this book yesterday.** (有具体过去时间（yesterday），不能用现在完成时)
- ❌ ~~He has gone to Beijing for 3 days.~~ → ✅ **He has been in Beijing for 3 days.** (have gone表示去了还没回来，不能与for连用)

**📌 例句：**
- She has already finished her homework.

## 2. 形容词/副词比较级

- 不规则变化：good/well→better, bad/badly→worse, many/much→more
- 比较级的修饰词：much, a lot, even, still, a little

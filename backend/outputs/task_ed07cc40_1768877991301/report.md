# 📖 语法

## 1. 现在进行时

**📝 定义：** 表示现在正在进行的动作，也可表示现阶段正在进行或即将发生的动作。

**📋 结构：** 主语 + am/is/are + 动词-ing

**💡 用法：**
- 表示说话时正在进行的动作：He is reading a book now.
- 表示现阶段正在进行的动作：She is learning French this year.
- 表示即将发生的动作（常用go, come, leave等）：I am leaving tomorrow.
- 与always连用表示赞扬或不满：He is always helping others.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~She is play the piano.~~ → ✅ **She is playing the piano.** (be动词后面要用动词的-ing形式)
- ❌ ~~I am knowing the answer.~~ → ✅ **I know the answer.** (know是状态动词，一般不用进行时)

**📌 例句：**
- They are watching TV at the moment.
- Look! The baby is crying.
- We are having an English class now.

## 2. 一般过去时

**📝 定义：** 表示过去某一时间发生的动作或存在的状态，也表示过去经常或反复发生的动作。

**📋 结构：** 主语 + 动词过去式（be动词用was/were）

**💡 用法：**
- 表示过去发生的动作：I visited my grandma yesterday.
- 表示过去存在的状态：He was a teacher ten years ago.
- 表示过去的习惯：When I was young, I often played football.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I go to Beijing last year.~~ → ✅ **I went to Beijing last year.** (有过去时间标志词（last year），动词要用过去式)
- ❌ ~~Did you went there?~~ → ✅ **Did you go there?** (did后面的动词要用原形)

**📌 例句：**
- She bought a new dress yesterday.
- They were happy at the party.
- I didn't watch TV last night.

## 3. 现在完成时

**📝 定义：** 表示过去发生的动作对现在造成的影响或结果，也表示从过去持续到现在的动作或状态。

**📋 结构：** 主语 + have/has + 过去分词

**💡 用法：**
- 表示过去的动作对现在的影响：I have lost my key. (现在没有钥匙)
- 表示经历：Have you ever been to Beijing?
- 表示持续到现在的状态：I have lived here for 10 years.
- 常与already, yet, just, ever, never, for, since连用

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I have see the movie.~~ → ✅ **I have seen the movie.** (have/has后面要用动词的过去分词形式)
- ❌ ~~I have bought this book yesterday.~~ → ✅ **I bought this book yesterday.** (有具体过去时间（yesterday），不能用现在完成时)
- ❌ ~~He has gone to Beijing for 3 days.~~ → ✅ **He has been in Beijing for 3 days.** (have gone表示去了还没回来，不能与for连用)

**📌 例句：**
- She has already finished her homework.
- I have never met him before.
- We have known each other since 2020.

## 4. 被动语态

**📝 定义：** 当主语是动作的承受者时，使用被动语态。强调动作的承受者或动作本身。

**📋 结构：** 主语 + be + 过去分词 + (by + 动作执行者)

**💡 用法：**
- 不知道或不必说明动作执行者：The window was broken.
- 强调动作承受者：The book was written by Lu Xun.
- 客观报道或正式场合：The meeting will be held tomorrow.
- 各种时态的被动：is done, was done, will be done, has been done等

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~The car was repair yesterday.~~ → ✅ **The car was repaired yesterday.** (be后面要用动词的过去分词)
- ❌ ~~The book is belonged to me.~~ → ✅ **The book belongs to me.** (belong是不及物动词，没有被动语态)

**📌 例句：**
- English is spoken all over the world.
- The bridge was built in 1990.
- The work must be finished on time.

## 5. 动词不规则变化

**📝 定义：** 部分动词过去式和过去分词不按规则变化

**📋 结构：** do–did–done

**💡 用法：**
- 需单独记忆
- 常考

**📌 例句：**

- see–saw–seen

## 6. 一般疑问句

**📝 定义：** 用yes或no回答的疑问句，通常将助动词、be动词或情态动词放在主语前。

**📋 结构：** 助动词/Be动词/情态动词 + 主语 + 动词(原形) + 其他?

**💡 用法：**
- be动词开头：Are you a student? — Yes, I am. / No, I'm not.
- 助动词开头：Do you like English? — Yes, I do. / No, I don't.
- 情态动词开头：Can you swim? — Yes, I can. / No, I can't.
- 回答要与问句保持一致

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Does he likes music?~~ → ✅ **Does he like music?** (does后面动词要用原形)
- ❌ ~~Are you a teacher? — Yes, you are.~~ → ✅ **Are you a teacher? — Yes, I am.** (回答时主语要变换，you变I)
- ❌ ~~Do you can swim?~~ → ✅ **Can you swim?** (情态动词can不能与do连用)

**📌 例句：**

## 7. 特殊疑问句

**📝 定义：** 用特殊疑问词（what, who, where, when, why, how等）提问的句子，不能用yes或no回答。

- where问地点：Where do you live?
- when问时间：When did you arrive?
- why问原因：Why are you late?
- how问方式/程度：How do you go to school? / How old are you?

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~What you want?~~ → ✅ **What do you want?** (特殊疑问句需要助动词（疑问词作主语时除外）)
- ❌ ~~Who did break the window?~~ → ✅ **Who broke the window?** (who作主语时，不需要助动词did)

**📌 例句：**
- What time does the movie start?

## 8. 宾语从句

**📝 定义：** 在复合句中作宾语的从句，通常放在主句谓语动词、介词或形容词之后。

**📋 结构：** 主句 + 引导词(that/wh-/if/whether) + 陈述语序

**💡 用法：**
- that引导（可省略）：I think (that) he is right.
- wh-词引导：I don't know what his name is.
- if/whether引导：I wonder if/whether he will come.
- 注意宾语从句要用陈述语序

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I don't know where is he.~~ → ✅ **I don't know where he is.** (宾语从句要用陈述语序，不用疑问语序)
- ❌ ~~He asked me that where I lived.~~ → ✅ **He asked me where I lived.** (特殊疑问词引导时不需要that)
- ❌ ~~I wonder if will he come.~~ → ✅ **I wonder if he will come.** (if引导的宾语从句要用陈述语序)

**📌 例句：**
- I believe that you can do it.
- Could you tell me how I can get to the station?
- I'm not sure whether it will rain tomorrow.

## 9. 定语从句

**📝 定义：** 在复合句中修饰名词或代词的从句，通常紧跟在被修饰的词（先行词）之后。

**📋 结构：** 先行词 + 关系词(who/which/that/whose/where/when) + 从句

**💡 用法：**
- who/that指人：The man who/that is talking is my father.
- which/that指物：The book which/that I bought is interesting.
- whose表所属：The girl whose mother is a doctor is my friend.
- where指地点：This is the school where I studied.
- when指时间：I still remember the day when I met you.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~The man which is talking is my teacher.~~ → ✅ **The man who/that is talking is my teacher.** (先行词是人时，用who或that，不用which)
- ❌ ~~The book who I bought is good.~~ → ✅ **The book which/that I bought is good.** (先行词是物时，用which或that，不用who)
- ❌ ~~This is the place where I visited.~~ → ✅ **This is the place which/that I visited.** (visit是及物动词，需要宾语，用which/that而非where)

**📌 例句：**
- I have a friend who can speak five languages.
- The movie that we saw last night was exciting.
- I'll never forget the day when I graduated.

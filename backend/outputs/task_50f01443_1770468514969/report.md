# 📖 语法

## 1. 形容词/副词比较级

**📝 定义：** 用于两者之间的比较，表示'更...'的意思。

**📋 结构：** 形容词/副词比较级 + than / more + 形容词/副词原级 + than

**💡 用法：**
- 单音节和部分双音节词：加-er（tall→taller, big→bigger）
- 多音节和部分双音节词：more + 原级（beautiful→more beautiful）
- 不规则变化：good/well→better, bad/badly→worse, many/much→more
- 比较级的修饰词：much, a lot, even, still, a little

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~She is more taller than me.~~ → ✅ **She is taller than me.** (tall是单音节词，用-er形式，不需要more)
- ❌ ~~He runs more fast than me.~~ → ✅ **He runs faster than me.** (fast的比较级是faster，不是more fast)
- ❌ ~~This book is more better.~~ → ✅ **This book is better / much better.** (good的比较级是better，不能用more修饰)

**📌 例句：**
- My sister is two years older than me.
- This question is more difficult than that one.
- He works much harder than before.

## 2. 现在完成时

**📝 定义：** 表示过去发生的动作对现在造成的影响或结果，也表示从过去持续到现在的动作或状态。

**📋 结构：** 主语 + have/has + 过去分词

**💡 用法：**
- 表示过去的动作对现在的影响：I have lost my key. (现在没有钥匙)
- 表示经历：Have you ever been to Beijing?
- 表示持续到现在的状态：I have lived here for 10 years.
- 常与already, yet, just, ever, never, for, since连用

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I have see the movie.~~ → ✅ **I have seen the movie.** (have/has后面要用动词的过去分词形式)
- ❌ ~~I have bought this book yesterday.~~ → ✅ **I bought this book yesterday.** (有具体过去时间（yesterday），不能用现在完成时)
- ❌ ~~He has gone to Beijing for 3 days.~~ → ✅ **He has been in Beijing for 3 days.** (have gone表示去了还没回来，不能与for连用)

**📌 例句：**
- She has already finished her homework.
- I have never met him before.
- We have known each other since 2020.

## 3. 形容词/副词最高级

**📝 定义：** 用于三者或三者以上的比较，表示'最...'的意思。

**📋 结构：** the + 形容词/副词最高级 + (in/of范围)

**💡 用法：**
- 单音节和部分双音节词：加-est（tall→tallest, big→biggest）
- 多音节和部分双音节词：most + 原级（beautiful→most beautiful）
- 不规则变化：good/well→best, bad/badly→worst, many/much→most
- 常与in+地点/of+范围连用

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~He is tallest in our class.~~ → ✅ **He is the tallest in our class.** (形容词最高级前要加the)
- ❌ ~~She is the most youngest.~~ → ✅ **She is the youngest.** (young是单音节词，最高级是youngest，不用most)
- ❌ ~~This is the best book of all the book.~~ → ✅ **This is the best book of all the books.** (of all后面的名词要用复数)

**📌 例句：**
- He is the tallest student in our class.
- This is the most interesting book I have ever read.
- She sings (the) best of all the students.

**📝 定义：** 用在名词前，说明名词所指的人或事物。分为不定冠词(a/an)、定冠词(the)和零冠词。

**📋 结构：** 冠词 + (形容词) + 名词

**💡 用法：**
- a/an用于泛指单数可数名词：a book, an apple (元音音素前用an)
- the用于特指、上文提过、独一无二的事物：the sun, the book I bought
- the + 形容词表示一类人：the rich (富人), the young (年轻人)
- 零冠词：复数名词和不可数名词泛指、球类运动、三餐、学科等

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I have a umbrella.~~ → ✅ **I have an umbrella.** (umbrella以元音音素开头，用an)
- ❌ ~~He is an university student.~~ → ✅ **He is a university student.** (university虽以u开头，但发音是辅音/ju:/，用a)

## 7. 倒装句

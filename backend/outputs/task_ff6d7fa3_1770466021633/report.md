# 📖 语法

## 1. 被动语态

**📝 定义：** 当主语是动作的承受者时，使用被动语态。强调动作的承受者或动作本身。

**📋 结构：** 主语 + be + 过去分词 + (by + 动作执行者)

**💡 用法：**
- 不知道或不必说明动作执行者：The window was broken.
- 强调动作承受者：The book was written by Lu Xun.
- 客观报道或正式场合：The meeting will be held tomorrow.
- 各种时态的被动：is done, was done, will be done, has been done等

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~The car was repair yesterday.~~ → ✅ **The car was repaired yesterday.** (be后面要用动词的过去分词)
- ❌ ~~The book is belonged to me.~~ → ✅ **The book belongs to me.** (belong是不及物动词，没有被动语态)

**📌 例句：**
- English is spoken all over the world.
- The bridge was built in 1990.
- The work must be finished on time.

## 2. 感叹句

**📝 定义：** 用来表达强烈感情的句子，句末用感叹号。常用What和How引导。

**📋 结构：** What + (a/an) + 形容词 + 名词 + 主语 + 谓语! / How + 形容词/副词 + 主语 + 谓语!

**💡 用法：**
- What + a/an + 形容词 + 可数名词单数：What a beautiful girl she is!
- What + 形容词 + 不可数名词/复数名词：What nice weather! What beautiful flowers!
- How + 形容词/副词：How beautiful the girl is! How fast he runs!
- 判断用What还是How：看中心词是名词还是形容词/副词

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~What beautiful girl she is!~~ → ✅ **What a beautiful girl she is!** (可数名词单数前要加a/an)
- ❌ ~~How a beautiful girl!~~ → ✅ **What a beautiful girl! / How beautiful the girl is!** (How后直接加形容词，不加冠词和名词)
- ❌ ~~What nice the weather is!~~ → ✅ **How nice the weather is! / What nice weather!** (What后要有名词，How后直接加形容词)

**📌 例句：**
- What an interesting story it is!
- What delicious food!
- How time flies!

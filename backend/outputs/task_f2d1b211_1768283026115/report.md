# 📖 语法知识

## 1. 动名词作主语（protecting the environment）

**📝 定义：** 当一个动作/行为作句子主语时，常用动名词（V-ing）表示“这件事/这个行为”。

**📋 结构：** V-ing (+ 宾语) + 谓语 + 其他

**💡 用法：**
- Protecting the environment 作整体主语，表示“一件事”。
- 动名词短语作主语时，谓语通常用单数形式（因为当作“一件事”）。

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Protect the environment becomes important.~~ → ✅ **Protecting the environment becomes important.** (这里主语是“保护环境这件事”，用动名词作主语更自然。)

**📌 例句：**
- Protecting the environment becomes more and more important.
- Planting trees can help clean the air.

## 2. 主谓一致：动名词短语作主语 + 谓语用单数

**📝 定义：** 当主语是动名词短语（表示一件事）时，谓语动词用第三人称单数。

**📋 结构：** V-ing ... + becomes/is/helps ...

**💡 用法：**
- 把整个动名词短语当作单数名词看待。
- 不要被后面的名词（如 environment）干扰，真正的主语是整个短语。

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Protecting the environment become more important.~~ → ✅ **Protecting the environment becomes more important.** (主语是“一件事”，谓语用单三 becomes。)

**📌 例句：**
- Protecting the environment becomes important.
- Saving energy helps a lot.

## 3. 比较级 vs “越来越”：more important 与 more and more important

**📝 定义：** more important 表示“更重要”（与另一个对象对比）；more and more important 表示“越来越重要”（随时间/程度递增）。

**📋 结构：** more + adj.（对比） / more and more + adj.（递增）

**💡 用法：**
- 对比两者：A is more important than B.
- 描述变化趋势：It is becoming more and more important.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~It is more important day by day.~~ → ✅ **It is more and more important day by day.** (day by day 表趋势，搭配 more and more 更准确。)

**📌 例句：**
- It is more important than before.
- Protecting the environment is becoming more and more important.

## 4. 时间状语从句：when 引导从句的动词形式（when we go out）

**📝 定义：** when 引导时间状语从句时，必须有完整的主谓结构；一般不用“when + 主语 + doing”来表达“当……时”。

**📋 结构：** when + 主语 + 谓语动词（常用一般现在时）

**💡 用法：**
- 表达习惯/规则：when we leave home, ...
- 表达将来时间（从句一般现在时）：when we go out tomorrow, ...

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~when we going out~~ → ✅ **when we go out** (when 从句需要谓语动词；going 不是谓语（缺少助动词）。)

**📌 例句：**
- Turn off the light when we leave home.
- We can walk when we go out.

## 5. 逗号拼接错误（comma splice）与连接词连接两句话

**📝 定义：** 英语中两句完整句子不能只用逗号连接；需要连词（and/but/so/because 等）或用句号/分号等。

**📋 结构：** 句子A + and/but/so + 句子B；或 句子A. 句子B.

**💡 用法：**
- 两句并列：..., and ...
- 转折：..., but ...
- 因果：..., so ... / ... because ...

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~We should protect the environment, it can make our life better.~~ → ✅ **We should protect the environment, and it can make our life better.** (两个完整句子需要连接词或改成两个句子。)
- ❌ ~~We should protect the environment, can make our life better.~~ → ✅ **We should protect the environment, and it can make our life better.** (后半句缺主语；同时两句需要连词。)

**📌 例句：**
- We should protect the environment, and it can make our life better.
- We should protect the environment. It can make our life better.

## 6. 代词指代与一致：it / them / this 的选择

**📝 定义：** it 指代单数/不可数或“一件事”；them 指代复数名词；this 可指代“这件事/这种做法”。需要保证指代清晰、数一致。

**📋 结构：** it（单数/一件事） / them（复数） / this（这件事）

**💡 用法：**
- 指代前面的一整件事：It can make our life better.
- 指代多个建议/方法：If everyone can do them, ...
- 指代某种做法：If everyone can do this, ...

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~First..., second..., if everyone can do it, ...~~ → ✅ **First..., second..., if everyone can do them, ...** (前面是两点/多项内容，应用 them 或 this 来保证一致与清晰。)

**📌 例句：**
- If everyone can do them, the environment will be better.
- If everyone can do this, the environment will be better.

## 7. 词汇辨析：tell / talk / speak（课堂提到的固定搭配）

**📝 定义：** tell 强调“告诉信息/命令”；talk 强调“交谈/讨论”；speak 常指“说（语言）/正式表达/讲话”。课堂重点在于搭配与宾语结构。

**📋 结构：** tell sb sth / tell sb to do sth / tell sb (that) 从句；talk about sth / talk to sb / talk with sb；speak to sb / speak English

**💡 用法：**
- tell：强调信息传递或让对方做事（常见 to do）。
- talk about：讨论某事；talk to/with：与某人交谈。
- speak：更正式；也常用于“说某种语言”（speak English）。

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~tell sb doing sth~~ → ✅ **tell sb to do sth** (课堂强调：tell 后面通常接 to do，不接 doing。)
- ❌ ~~talk something~~ → ✅ **talk about something** (talk 表“谈论某事”通常要加介词 about。)

**📌 例句：**
- He told me to turn off the light.
- Let’s talk about ways of protecting the environment.
- She can speak English well.

## 8. 词汇辨析：say vs speak（内容 vs 方式/语言）

**📝 定义：** say 强调“说的内容”；speak 更强调“说话的方式/能力”或“用某种语言说”。

**📋 结构：** say + 内容/that从句；speak + 语言 / speak to sb / speak up

**💡 用法：**
- 描述内容：He said that it would rain.
- 描述语言能力：She can speak English.
- 描述说话方式：Speak up!

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~He speak it will rain.~~ → ✅ **He said it will rain. / He said that it would rain.** (表达“说的内容”用 say（said），并用从句承载内容。)

**📌 例句：**
- He said that it would rain.
- She speaks English and Chinese.
- Please speak up.

## 9. 词汇辨析：talk to / talk with / talk about（搭配与侧重点）

**📝 定义：** talk about 强调“谈论话题”；talk to 强调“对某人说/交流”；talk with 强调“与某人交谈（双方互动）”。

**📋 结构：** talk about + 话题；talk to/with + 人

**💡 用法：**
- 谈论某事：talk about something
- 对某人说：talk to somebody
- 与某人交谈：talk with somebody

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~talk something~~ → ✅ **talk about something** (talk 表“谈论”通常需要 about。)

**📌 例句：**
- Let's talk about the plan.
- I want to talk to you.
- She talked with her friend.

## 10. 不规则动词变化与听力易考点：tell/speak/say/do

**📝 定义：** 部分常用动词过去式和过去分词不按 -ed 规则变化，需要记忆；听力可能直接考过去式读音。

**📋 结构：** tell-told-told；speak-spoke-spoken；say-said-said；do-did-done

**💡 用法：**
- 写作/语法填空需区分过去式与过去分词。
- 听力中常出现 said /sed/，要能听出并拼对。

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~tell-telled-telled~~ → ✅ **tell-told-told** (tell 为不规则动词。)
- ❌ ~~do-did-did (in present perfect)~~ → ✅ **have done** (现在完成时用过去分词 done。)

**📌 例句：**
- He told me the truth.
- She has spoken to the teacher.
- I have done my homework.

## 11. 过去式 vs 过去分词：用法区别

**📝 定义：** 过去式主要用于一般过去时（表示过去发生的动作）；过去分词用于完成时、被动语态，以及作形容词。

**📋 结构：** 一般过去时：V-ed/不规则过去式；现在完成：have/has + 过去分词；被动：be + 过去分词；形容词：过去分词 + 名词/作表语

**💡 用法：**
- 一般过去时：I ate rice yesterday.（过去式）
- 现在完成时：I have eaten rice.（过去分词）
- 被动语态：The apple is eaten by me.（过去分词）
- 形容词用法：the eaten apple / The apple is eaten.（表示“被吃的”状态）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I have did my homework.~~ → ✅ **I have done my homework.** (have 后必须用过去分词。)

**📌 例句：**
- I did my homework yesterday.
- I have already done my homework.
- The house is controlled by a central system.

## 12. 被动语态：be + 过去分词（含 be 动词多种形态）

**📝 定义：** 被动语态表示“主语是动作的承受者”，基本结构为 be + 过去分词；be 会随时态变化。

**📋 结构：** am/is/are + p.p.；was/were + p.p.；will be + p.p.；have/has been + p.p.；is/are being + p.p.

**💡 用法：**
- 现在被动：The house is controlled by a system.
- 过去被动：The house was controlled by a system.
- 完成被动：The house has been controlled by a system.
- 进行被动：The house is being controlled by a system.（课堂点名：is being）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~The house is controlling by a system.~~ → ✅ **The house is controlled by a system.** (被动要用过去分词，不用现在分词。)

**📌 例句：**
- The house is controlled by a central system.
- The apple was eaten by me.
- The machine is being repaired.

## 13. 过去分词作形容词：the eaten apple

**📝 定义：** 过去分词可作形容词，表示“被……的/处于……状态的”。

**📋 结构：** the + 过去分词 + 名词；be + 过去分词（表状态）

**💡 用法：**
- 前置定语：the eaten apple（被吃的苹果）
- 表语：The apple is eaten.（苹果处于“被吃了”的状态/结果）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~the eat apple~~ → ✅ **the eaten apple** (表示“被吃的”要用过去分词 eaten。)

**📌 例句：**
- the broken window
- the eaten apple
- The door is closed.

## 14. 词汇辨析：experiment vs experience（拼写相近但意义不同）

**📝 定义：** experiment 指“实验”；experience 指“经历/经验”。课堂强调不要混淆。

**📋 结构：** an experiment（一次实验）；have experience（有经验）

**💡 用法：**
- 科学实验：a successful experiment
- 工作经验：teaching experience

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~a successful experience (想表达“成功的实验”)~~ → ✅ **a successful experiment** (“实验”用 experiment，不用 experience。)

**📌 例句：**
- Proper preparation is essential for a successful experiment.
- She has rich experience in teaching.

## 15. 长句翻译技巧：找介词/连词，从后往前理结构

**📝 定义：** 英语长句常因介词短语/从句变长；翻译时先找介词/连词，把“附加信息”拆出来，再回到主干（主谓宾）翻译。

**📋 结构：** 主干（主谓宾） + 介词短语/从句（修饰成分）

**💡 用法：**
- 先锁定主干：Proper preparation is essential.
- 再处理附加部分：in science class / for a successful experiment 等，通常放在后面或前置作状语。

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~合适的准备是重要的对于一个成功的实验在科学课上。~~ → ✅ **在科学课上，对于一次成功的实验来说，恰当的准备非常重要。** (先拆介词短语，再翻主干更通顺。)

**📌 例句：**
- Proper preparation is essential for a successful experiment.
- In science class, proper preparation is essential for a successful experiment.

## 16. 介词后必须接名词：介词 + 名词/动名词

**📝 定义：** 介词后不能直接接动词原形；要接名词、代词或动名词（V-ing 视作名词）。

**📋 结构：** prep. + n./pron./V-ing

**💡 用法：**
- without + V-ing：without saying...
- into + n./V-ing：into management / into doing...
- for + n./V-ing：for success / for learning...

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~into manage~~ → ✅ **into management** (into 是介词，后面要名词；manage 应变名词 management。)
- ❌ ~~without say goodbye~~ → ✅ **without saying goodbye** (without 后接动名词 saying。)

**📌 例句：**
- She wants to enter into management.
- He left without saying goodbye.

## 17. to do 与 doing：两种“动词变名词”的方式

**📝 定义：** 动词可通过动名词（doing）或不定式（to do）构成整体：都可作名词性成分，但使用场景不同；介词后通常只能用名词/doing，不用 to do。

**📋 结构：** V-ing（单词形式）/ to + V（两词整体）

**💡 用法：**
- 作主语：Doing exercise is good. / To exercise is good.
- 介词后：interested in doing / without doing（不用 in to do）。
- 表示目的：to do 常表目的（I came here to learn.）。

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~without to say~~ → ✅ **without saying** (介词 without 后不能接 to do。)

**📌 例句：**
- To learn English takes time.
- Learning English takes time.
- He left without saying anything.

## 18. 词性变化：动词变名词的常见后缀 -ment / -er

**📝 定义：** 英语常用后缀把动词变成名词：-ment 表“行为/结果/领域”；-er 表“做某事的人”。

**📋 结构：** manage → management；manage → manager；foreign → foreigner

**💡 用法：**
- management 表“管理/管理层”；manager 表“经理/管理者”。
- foreigner 表“外国人”（可数）。

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~into manage (名词位置)~~ → ✅ **into management** (需要名词，不能用动词原形。)

**📌 例句：**
- Good management matters.
- The manager made a decision.
- A foreigner asked for help.

## 19. It is 强调句（强调结构）

**📝 定义：** It is/was ... that/who ... 用于强调句子中的某一部分（主语/宾语/状语等）。

**📋 结构：** It is/was + 被强调部分 + that/who + 句子其余部分

**💡 用法：**
- 强调人可用 who：It was Tom who did it.
- 强调其他成分常用 that：It is in class that we learned it.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~It is surprised to such a little boy ...~~ → ✅ **It is surprising to see such a little boy speak a foreign language fluently.** (形容“令人惊讶”用 surprising；结构上用 to see... 更自然。)

**📌 例句：**
- It was in science class that we did the experiment.
- It is Tom who speaks English fluently.

## 20. 感受类用法：surprised vs surprising（人感受 vs 事物特征）

**📝 定义：** surprised 描述人的感受；surprising 描述事物“令人惊讶”的特征。

**📋 结构：** be surprised + to do/at sth；It is surprising + to do/that 从句

**💡 用法：**
- 人：I was surprised to see him.
- 事：It is surprising to see a little boy speak so fluently.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I am surprising.~~ → ✅ **I am surprised.** (人用 surprised，不用 surprising。)

**📌 例句：**
- I was surprised to hear the news.
- It is surprising that he can speak so fluently.

## 21. 感官动词 + 宾语 + do/doing：see sb do vs see sb doing

**📝 定义：** see sb do 强调看见动作从头到尾（全过程/结果）；see sb doing 强调看见动作正在发生（进行中）。

**📋 结构：** see + sb + do sth / see + sb + doing sth

**💡 用法：**
- 全过程：I saw him enter the room.
- 进行中：I saw him entering the room.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~See somebody to do something~~ → ✅ **See somebody do something / See somebody doing something** (感官动词后不用 to do（除少数特殊结构）。)

**📌 例句：**
- I saw her cross the street.
- I saw her crossing the street.

## 22. 固定搭配：invite sb to do 与 ask sb to do（不接 doing）

**📝 定义：** invite/ask 表“邀请/要求”时，常用不定式 to do 表将来/未发生的动作；不用 doing。

**📋 结构：** invite/ask + sb + to do sth

**💡 用法：**
- 邀请：They invited me to join.
- 要求：Miss Liu asked us to be quiet.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~invite somebody doing something~~ → ✅ **invite somebody to do something** (邀请是让对方去做，还没发生，用 to do。)
- ❌ ~~ask somebody to doing something~~ → ✅ **ask somebody to do something** (ask 后接 to do，不接 to doing。)

**📌 例句：**
- They invited him to give a speech.
- The teacher asked us to stop talking.

## 23. 称呼用法：Miss / Mrs. / Ms. / Mr.

**📝 定义：** Miss 用于未婚女性或对女老师的称呼；Mrs. 用于已婚女性；Ms. 不强调婚姻状况；Mr. 用于男性。

**📋 结构：** Miss/Mrs./Ms./Mr. + 姓氏

**💡 用法：**
- 未婚或老师：Miss Liu
- 已婚：Mrs. Smith
- 不强调婚姻状况：Ms. Wang
- 男性：Mr. Brown

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Mr. Liu (指女老师)~~ → ✅ **Miss Liu / Ms. Liu** (Mr. 仅用于男性。)

**📌 例句：**
- Miss Liu asked us to be quiet.
- Ms. Wang will meet the parents.

## 24. 介词后接名词或动名词：without + V-ing

**📝 定义：** 介词后不能直接接动词原形；通常接名词、代词或动名词（V-ing 充当名词）。

**📋 结构：** prep. + n./pron./V-ing

**💡 用法：**
- without + V-ing：表示“没有做某事”。
- 这是常考点：看到介词就优先考虑名词或 V-ing。

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~without say goodbye~~ → ✅ **without saying goodbye** (without 是介词，后面用动名词 saying。)
- ❌ ~~without to say goodbye~~ → ✅ **without saying goodbye** (介词后一般不用 to do。)

**📌 例句：**
- He left without saying goodbye.
- She passed the exam without studying much.

## 25. 一般疑问句变法：be/have/情态动词提前；没有则用 do/does/did

**📝 定义：** 把陈述句改一般疑问句：若句中有 be、have（完成时）、情态动词（can/will 等），直接提前；若是实义动词句且没有这些词，则借助 do/does/did。

**📋 结构：** be + 主语 + ... ?,have/has + 主语 + p.p. ... ?,情态动词 + 主语 + 动词原形 ... ?,do/does/did + 主语 + 动词原形 ... ?

**💡 用法：**
- 判断要用 do/does/did：看原句谓语动词形态（原形→do/does；过去式→did）。
- 课堂强调：不能凭感觉乱用 does/did，必须看动词形态或主语三单。

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Does you like it?~~ → ✅ **Do you like it?** (主语是 you，用 do，不用 does。)
- ❌ ~~Do he like it?~~ → ✅ **Does he like it?** (主语 he 是第三人称单数，用 does。)
- ❌ ~~Do you made it?~~ → ✅ **Did you make it?** (原句动词是过去式 made，对应助动词 did，后面动词用原形 make。)

**📌 例句：**
- You like apples. → Do you like apples?
- He likes apples. → Does he like apples?
- They made a cake. → Did they make a cake?
- He has finished. → Has he finished?

## 26. 否定句变法：实义动词用 do/does/did + not；have 表“拥有”用 do/does

**📝 定义：** 把句子改否定：be 动词后直接加 not；实义动词句用 do/does/did + not + 原形；have 若表示“拥有”常用 do/does（doesn't have），不要混成 hasn't have。

**📋 结构：** be + not + ...,do/does/did + not + 动词原形,主语 + doesn't have + 名词

**💡 用法：**
- 课堂强调：doesn't have（拥有）常考；现在完成才用 hasn't/haven't + p.p.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~He hasn't a book. (想表达“他没有书”)~~ → ✅ **He doesn't have a book.** (have 表“拥有”时通常用 do/does 构成否定。)
- ❌ ~~He doesn't have some books.~~ → ✅ **He doesn't have any books.** (否定句中 some 常改为 any。)

**📌 例句：**
- He has a book. → He doesn't have a book.
- She is ready. → She is not ready.

## 27. 对划线部分提问：Wh- 词 + 一般疑问句语序

**📝 定义：** 对句中某部分提问：先确定划线内容的类别（人/物/时间/地点/原因等）选 Wh- 词；再把剩余部分改成一般疑问句语序（be/have/情态提前，否则用 do/does/did）。

**📋 结构：** Wh- + (be/have/情态/do/does/did) + 主语 + 动词原形 ... ?

**💡 用法：**
- 课堂步骤：①划线部分换成 Wh- 词；②未划线部分变一般疑问句。
- 若划线是名词性内容（宾语），常用 what/which 来问“什么”。

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~What the oven tells us?~~ → ✅ **What does the oven tell us?** (实义动词 tells 需用助动词 does，且动词回到原形 tell。)

**📌 例句：**
- The oven tells us the time. → What does the oven tell us?
- She eats apples. → What does she eat?

## 28. 宾语从句：作宾语的“句子”

**📝 定义：** 宾语从句是“做宾语的句子”，在句子中充当名词性成分（宾语）。课堂用“书柜=放书的柜子”类比帮助理解。

**📋 结构：** 动词/介词 + (that/wh-等) + 从句

**💡 用法：**
- 它本质上是名词性成分，所以常对应“问名词用 what/which”。
- 常见：tell/know/ask + what/when/where + 从句。

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I don't know he is who.~~ → ✅ **I don't know who he is.** (wh- 引导的宾语从句语序为陈述语序（who he is）。)

**📌 例句：**
- I know what he wants.
- She asked where we were going.

## 29. 第三人称单数：does/动词加 -s 的判断

**📝 定义：** “三单”指第三人称单数（he/she/it/单数名词），一般现在时实义动词要加 -s/-es；构成疑问/否定时用 does，动词还原为原形。

**📋 结构：** he/she/it + V-s；Does + he/she/it + V 原形 ... ?

**💡 用法：**
- The oven 是 it（第三人称单数）→ 用 does / 动词加 s。
- I/you/we/they 不属于第三人称单数 → 用 do，动词不加 s。

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~The oven tell us ...~~ → ✅ **The oven tells us ...** (一般现在时第三人称单数谓语动词加 -s。)
- ❌ ~~Does the oven tells us ... ?~~ → ✅ **Does the oven tell us ... ?** (有 does 后，动词用原形 tell。)

**📌 例句：**
- He likes apples.
- Does he like apples?
- The oven tells us the time.

## 30. 一般疑问句：看原句动词形态选择 do/does/did

**📝 定义：** 当句子谓语是实义动词且没有 be/have/情态动词时，把陈述句变一般疑问句要借助 do/does/did；选择依据是原句动词的时态与主语三单。

**📋 结构：** Do/Does/Did + 主语 + 动词原形 ... ?

**💡 用法：**
- 原句动词原形（一般现在时，非三单）：用 do。
- 原句动词三单（一般现在时，三单）：用 does。
- 原句动词过去式（一般过去时）：用 did。

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Does they grow vegetables?~~ → ✅ **Do they grow vegetables?** (主语 they 非三单，用 do。)
- ❌ ~~Do he grew fast?~~ → ✅ **Did he grow fast?** (原句是过去式 grew，应使用 did，且动词还原 grow。)

**📌 例句：**
- They grow vegetables. → Do they grow vegetables?
- He grows vegetables. → Does he grow vegetables?
- They grew vegetables. → Did they grow vegetables?

## 31. 不规则动词：grow-grew-grown（过去式与过去分词）

**📝 定义：** grow 是不规则动词：过去式 grew 用于一般过去时；过去分词 grown 用于完成时/被动等结构。

**📋 结构：** grow — grew — grown

**💡 用法：**
- 过去：The tree grew quickly.
- 完成：The tree has grown quickly.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~The tree has grew.~~ → ✅ **The tree has grown.** (has/have 后用过去分词 grown，不用过去式 grew。)

**📌 例句：**
- The plants grew well last year.
- The plants have grown a lot this year.

## 32. 名词加 e 变动词：bath/bathe 与 breath/breathe（拼写+读音变化）

**📝 定义：** 有些词名词形式不带 e，动词形式在词尾加 e，且读音常发生变化（尤其元音与 th 清浊）。

**📋 结构：** noun (no e) → verb (+ e)

**💡 用法：**
- bath /bæθ/（名词）→ bathe /beɪð/（动词）
- breath /breθ/（名词）→ breathe /briːð/（动词）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I took a breathe.~~ → ✅ **I took a breath.** (take a breath 用名词 breath。)
- ❌ ~~I can breath well.~~ → ✅ **I can breathe well.** (情态动词 can 后接动词原形 breathe。)

**📌 例句：**
- Take a deep breath.
- It is hard to breathe here.
- He bathed the baby.

## 33. 词汇辨析：spend 的核心含义（花费）与语境翻译

**📝 定义：** spend 的核心含义是“花费”；当宾语是时间并强调时间流逝，可译为“度过”。做阅读时要根据搭配选择更准确的翻译。

**📋 结构：** spend + 时间/金钱 + (on sth / doing sth)

**💡 用法：**
- 花费时间做某事：spend time doing sth
- 花费金钱在某物上：spend money on sth

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~They spend money doing homework.~~ → ✅ **They spend time doing homework. / They spend money on books.** (time 常搭 doing；money 常搭 on + 名词。)

**📌 例句：**
- They spend time helping others.
- She spent money on a new computer.

## 34. 阅读定位技巧：题干关键词交叉定位

**📝 定义：** 做阅读不一定通读全文：先读懂题干，抓稳定关键词（名词/专有名词/时间地点），用“两个信息交叉”的方式快速定位答案段落。

**📋 结构：** 关键词1 + 关键词2 → 锁定段落/句子

**💡 用法：**
- 如题干包含 USA + young people + volunteer：优先在文章中找 USA/young/volunteer 等名词。
- 再核对动词搭配与选项细节（如 spend time doing）。

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~只看选项不读题干关键词~~ → ✅ **先读题干→抓名词关键词→回文定位→再比较选项** (题干读不懂会导致定位错段、选项靠猜。)

**📌 例句：**
- Young people in the USA volunteer to help others.
- In summer, Alice volunteers at a hospital.

## 35. 阅读定位：两个信息交叉定位（双条件定位）

**📝 定义：** 题干往往含有两条信息（人名/时间/地点/事件等）。先找到信息A对应位置，再在其附近用信息B交叉确认，锁定答案句。

**📋 结构：** 关键词A（人名/专有名词） + 关键词B（时间/地点/动作） → 答案位置

**💡 用法：**
- 先找稳定不变的名词/专有名词（如 Alice/Bill/USA）。
- 再找第二条信息（如 in summer / spend the whole summer）。
- 两条信息交叉出现的位置，就是答案高概率区域。

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~只找到 Alice 就直接选答案~~ → ✅ **找到 Alice 后，再找 summer 信息交叉确认** (只用一个信息容易落入干扰项。)

**📌 例句：**
- 题干：Alice + in summer → 在 Alice 段落里再找 summer。
- 题干：Bill + spend the whole summer → 找到 Bill 后再核对 spend the whole summer。

## 36. 后置定语与定语从句：修饰名词的成分放在名词后面

**📝 定义：** 后置定语是“放在名词后面的修饰成分”。后置定语可以是介词短语，也可以是从句；其中“名词 + that/who/which + 从句”叫定语从句。

**📋 结构：** 名词 + 介词短语（后置定语）：the apple on the tree,名词 + 定语从句（后置定语）：families that are not rich

**💡 用法：**
- 判断是不是定语从句：看被修饰的名词（先行词）+ 引导词（that/who/which）+ 后面是否是完整从句。
- 后置原因：修饰成分较长/较复杂时放后面更清楚。

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~on the tree apple~~ → ✅ **the apple on the tree** (介词短语作后置定语，放名词后更清晰。)
- ❌ ~~that are not rich families~~ → ✅ **families that are not rich** (定语从句修饰 families，应放在 families 后面。)

**📌 例句：**
- I like the book on the desk.
- They help families that are not rich.

## 37. that 的两种常见身份：连词 vs 关系代词

**📝 定义：** that 既可以作连词引导宾语从句（不充当成分），也可以作关系代词引导定语从句（在从句中充当成分，如宾语/主语）。

**📋 结构：** 宾语从句：V + that + 从句（that≈连词）,定语从句：名词 + that + 从句（that≈关系代词）

**💡 用法：**
- 看 that 前面：若是动词（know/think/say 等），多为宾语从句。
- 若 that 前面是名词（families/books/people 等），多为定语从句。

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~把所有 that 都当代词理解为“那个”~~ → ✅ **根据 that 前面的词判断：动词前后→宾语从句；名词后面→定语从句** (人名前一般不加“那个+名字”，因此常见 that 在句中多是连接成分。)

**📌 例句：**
- I know that Jason is 18. (宾语从句)
- families that are not rich (定语从句)

## 38. 宾语从句：做宾语的“句子”

**📝 定义：** 宾语从句是在句子中充当宾语的从句，整体相当于名词，用来回答“知道/认为/说/问什么”。

**📋 结构：** 动词 + (that/wh-) + 从句（陈述语序）

**💡 用法：**
- know/think/say/ask + that 从句：I know that ...
- wh- 引导：I know what he wants / where he lives

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I know what does he want.~~ → ✅ **I know what he wants.** (宾语从句用陈述语序，不用疑问语序。)

**📌 例句：**
- We know from the passage that Jason is 18.
- I don't know where he lives.

## 39. the + 形容词：表示“一类人”

**📝 定义：** the + 形容词可表示某一类人（复数概念），常用于表达群体：the rich / the poor / the old / the young。

**📋 结构：** the + adj. → 一类人（复数意义）

**💡 用法：**
- the rich：富人
- the old：老人
- the young：年轻人

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~the rich people people~~ → ✅ **the rich / rich people** (the rich 本身已表示“富人”群体，不必重复 people。)

**📌 例句：**
- The rich should help the poor.
- The young learn faster than the old.

## 40. 双宾语结构：teach + sb + sth（主谓双宾）

**📝 定义：** 有些动词可以带两个宾语：间接宾语（人）+ 直接宾语（物/内容）。teach 属于常见双宾语动词。

**📋 结构：** teach + 人 + 内容

**💡 用法：**
- teach sb sth：She taught me English.
- teach sb how to do sth：He taught people how to build houses.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~He taught to people how to build houses.~~ → ✅ **He taught people how to build houses.** (teach 后可直接接人作间接宾语，不必加 to。)

**📌 例句：**
- The teacher taught us math.
- He teaches people how to build a low-cost house.

## 41. 翻译策略：何时“从后往前翻”

**📝 定义：** 当句子因介词短语/连词/从句导致结构变长、信息被“切断”时，翻译可先处理后置部分（介词短语/从句），再回到主干；若句子短且主谓宾清晰，则按正常顺序翻译即可。

**📋 结构：** 短句：主谓宾顺翻,长句：先翻修饰成分（介词短语/从句）→再翻主干

**💡 用法：**
- 看到介词/连词/that/wh- 等，通常意味着后面有修饰或从句，先拆出来。
- 先翻介词短语（如 in reading）→再加“的”→回到名词（children）。

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~把所有句子都机械从后往前翻~~ → ✅ **看是否有介词/连词/从句导致结构复杂，再决定是否从后往前** (无介词连词时直接顺翻更自然。)

**📌 例句：**
- children with trouble in reading → 在阅读中有困难的孩子
- He teaches children. → 他教孩子（顺翻）

## 42. 后置定语：修饰成分通常修饰“最近的名词”

**📝 定义：** 后置定语（介词短语/从句）一般修饰它前面最近的名词（先行词）。因此一个修饰成分通常只对应一个名词，避免“同时修饰两个”造成歧义。

**📋 结构：** 名词 + 介词短语：children with trouble in reading,名词 + 定语从句：children that have trouble in reading

**💡 用法：**
- 判断修饰谁：先找修饰成分前面最近的名词。
- 阅读中后置定语多，会让句子变长、难懂，是阅读理解的常见难点。

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~把后置定语理解为同时修饰两个成分~~ → ✅ **默认修饰最近的名词（先行词）** (英语表达追求明确，修饰范围通常就近原则。)

**📌 例句：**
- the apple on the tree（on the tree 修饰 apple）
- families that are not rich（that 从句修饰 families）

## 43. 动名词短语作主语：Reading books ...

**📝 定义：** 动词加 -ing 可作为名词使用；动名词短语作主语时，整体视为“一件事”，谓语动词用第三人称单数形式（一般现在时常加 -s）。

**📋 结构：** V-ing (+ 宾语) + 谓语（单数）

**💡 用法：**
- Reading books is helpful.
- Reading books makes people better.
- 关键：主语不是 books，而是 Reading books 这“一件事”。

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Reading books make people better.~~ → ✅ **Reading books makes people better.** (动名词短语作主语视为单数，谓语用 makes。)
- ❌ ~~Read books makes people better.~~ → ✅ **Reading books makes people better.** (作主语需名词化：用 Reading books（动名词短语）。)

**📌 例句：**
- Reading books makes me better every day.
- Reading books helps us improve.

## 44. 主谓一致：看主语而不是看最近的名词复数

**📝 定义：** 谓语动词是否加 -s 取决于主语的人称和单复数。即使主语短语里出现复数名词（books），也要以整个主语短语的核心（Reading books 这件事）为准。

**📋 结构：** 主语（单数/复数） → 谓语动词形式

**💡 用法：**
- Reading books（单数概念）→ makes
- Books（复数）→ make

**⚠️ 易错点：**

**📋 结构：** 主语 + have/has + 过去分词

**💡 用法：**
- 表示过去的动作对现在的影响：I have lost my key. (现在没有钥匙)
- 表示经历：Have you ever been to Beijing?
- 表示持续到现在的状态：I have lived here for 10 years.
- 常与already, yet, just, ever, never, for, since连用

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I have see the movie.~~ → ✅ **I have seen the movie.** (have/has后面要用动词的过去分词形式)
- ❌ ~~I have bought this book yesterday.~~ → ✅ **I bought this book yesterday.** (有具体过去时间（yesterday），不能用现在完成时)
- ❌ ~~He has gone to Beijing for 3 days.~~ → ✅ **He has been in Beijing for 3 days.** (have gone表示去了还没回来，不能与for连用)

**📌 例句：**
- She has already finished her homework.

## 2. 形容词/副词比较级

- 比较级的修饰词：much, a lot, even, still, a little

- ❌ ~~She is more taller than me.~~ → ✅ **She is taller than me.** (tall是单音节词，用-er形式，不需要more)
- ❌ ~~He runs more fast than me.~~ → ✅ **He runs faster than me.** (fast的比较级是faster，不是more fast)
- ❌ ~~This book is more better.~~ → ✅ **This book is better / much better.** (good的比较级是better，不能用more修饰)

- My sister is two years older than me.

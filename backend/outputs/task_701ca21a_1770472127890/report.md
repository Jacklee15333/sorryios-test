# 📖 语法

## 1. 动名词 (v. -ing作名词)

**📝 定义：** 由动词-ing形式构成，具有名词性质，可以作主语、宾语、表语等。

**📋 结构：** 动词-ing

**💡 用法：**
- 作主语：Swimming is good for health.
- 作宾语：I enjoy reading books. / Thank you for helping me.
- 作表语：My hobby is collecting stamps.
- 某些动词后只能接动名词：enjoy, finish, mind, practice, avoid, consider等

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I enjoy to swim.~~ → ✅ **I enjoy swimming.** (enjoy后只能接动名词，不能接不定式)
- ❌ ~~Thank you for help me.~~ → ✅ **Thank you for helping me.** (介词后要用动名词)

**📌 例句：**
- Reading makes a full man.
- Would you mind opening the window?
- She is good at playing the piano.

## 2. 宾语从句

**📝 定义：** 在复合句中作宾语的从句，通常放在主句谓语动词、介词或形容词之后。

**📋 结构：** 主句 + 引导词(that/wh-/if/whether) + 陈述语序

**💡 用法：**
- that引导（可省略）：I think (that) he is right.
- wh-词引导：I don't know what his name is.
- if/whether引导：I wonder if/whether he will come.
- 注意宾语从句要用陈述语序

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I don't know where is he.~~ → ✅ **I don't know where he is.** (宾语从句要用陈述语序，不用疑问语序)
- ❌ ~~He asked me that where I lived.~~ → ✅ **He asked me where I lived.** (特殊疑问词引导时不需要that)
- ❌ ~~I wonder if will he come.~~ → ✅ **I wonder if he will come.** (if引导的宾语从句要用陈述语序)

**📌 例句：**
- I believe that you can do it.
- Could you tell me how I can get to the station?
- I'm not sure whether it will rain tomorrow.

## 3. 现在完成时

**📝 定义：** 表示过去发生的动作对现在造成的影响或结果，也表示从过去持续到现在的动作或状态。

**📋 结构：** 主语 + have/has + 过去分词

**💡 用法：**
- 表示过去的动作对现在的影响：I have lost my key. (现在没有钥匙)
- 表示经历：Have you ever been to Beijing?
- 表示持续到现在的状态：I have lived here for 10 years.
- 常与already, yet, just, ever, never, for, since连用

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I have see the movie.~~ → ✅ **I have seen the movie.** (have/has后面要用动词的过去分词形式)
- ❌ ~~I have bought this book yesterday.~~ → ✅ **I bought this book yesterday.** (有具体过去时间（yesterday），不能用现在完成时)
- ❌ ~~He has gone to Beijing for 3 days.~~ → ✅ **He has been in Beijing for 3 days.** (have gone表示去了还没回来，不能与for连用)

**📌 例句：**
- She has already finished her homework.
- I have never met him before.
- We have known each other since 2020.

## 4. 定语从句

**📝 定义：** 在复合句中修饰名词或代词的从句，通常紧跟在被修饰的词（先行词）之后。

**📋 结构：** 先行词 + 关系词(who/which/that/whose/where/when) + 从句

**💡 用法：**
- who/that指人：The man who/that is talking is my father.
- which/that指物：The book which/that I bought is interesting.
- whose表所属：The girl whose mother is a doctor is my friend.
- where指地点：This is the school where I studied.
- when指时间：I still remember the day when I met you.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~The man which is talking is my teacher.~~ → ✅ **The man who/that is talking is my teacher.** (先行词是人时，用who或that，不用which)
- ❌ ~~The book who I bought is good.~~ → ✅ **The book which/that I bought is good.** (先行词是物时，用which或that，不用who)
- ❌ ~~This is the place where I visited.~~ → ✅ **This is the place which/that I visited.** (visit是及物动词，需要宾语，用which/that而非where)

**📌 例句：**
- I have a friend who can speak five languages.
- The movie that we saw last night was exciting.
- I'll never forget the day when I graduated.

## 5. 情态动词

- may/might 表许可、可能：May I come in? / It may rain.
- must 表必须、肯定推测：You must finish it. / He must be at home.
- should 表应该、建议：You should study hard.
- need 表需要（否定needn't）：You needn't worry.

**⚠️ 易错点：**

- ❌ ~~Must I finish it? — No, you mustn't.~~ → ✅ **Must I finish it? — No, you needn't/don't have to.** (must的否定回答用needn't或don't have to，mustn't表禁止)
- ❌ ~~He must be not at home.~~ → ✅ **He can't be at home.** (must be的否定是can't be，不是must not be)

**📌 例句：**
- Can you speak Japanese?
- You must hand in your homework on time.
- You should be more careful.

# 📖 语法知识

## 1. important 的介词搭配：important to somebody

**📝 定义：** 表示“对某人来说重要”，常用 important to somebody；不要随意换介词导致语义不清。

**📋 结构：** be important to somebody

**💡 用法：**
- 表示“对每个人都重要”：It is important to everyone.
- 写作中可用：Protecting the environment is important to everyone.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~It is important for everyone. (想表达“对每个人重要”时易写成这样)~~ → ✅ **It is important to everyone.** (important 后面表达“对某人”通常用 to；for 更常见于 It is + adj + for sb + to do 的结构里。)

**📌 例句：**
- It is important to everyone.
- Protecting the environment is important to us.

## 2. 动词变名词：动名词（V-ing）作主语

**📝 定义：** 当一个动作/事情充当句子主语时，英语常用 V-ing（动名词）来表示“这件事”。

**📋 结构：** V-ing + ... + 谓语 + ...

**💡 用法：**
- 把动作当作“一件事”：Protecting the environment ...
- 动名词短语作主语时，整体看作“单数的一件事”。

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Protect the environment becomes important.~~ → ✅ **Protecting the environment becomes important.** (这里主语应是“保护环境这件事”，用 V-ing 作主语更自然。)

**📌 例句：**
- Protecting the environment becomes more and more important.
- Saving energy helps the planet.

## 3. 主谓一致：动名词短语作主语视为单数

**📝 定义：** 当主语是动名词短语（如 Protecting the environment）时，谓语动词一般用第三人称单数形式。

**📋 结构：** V-ing 短语（单数） + 动词三单（-s/-es）

**💡 用法：**
- Protecting the environment becomes ...（becomes 用三单）
- 动名词短语虽然包含多个词，但语义上是一件事。

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Protecting the environment become more important.~~ → ✅ **Protecting the environment becomes more important.** (动名词短语作主语整体为单数，谓语要用三单。)

**📌 例句：**
- Protecting the environment becomes more and more important.
- Planting trees helps clean the air.

## 4. 比较表达：more important vs more and more important

**📝 定义：** more important 表示“更重要（比较对象通常明确）”；more and more important 表示“越来越重要（变化趋势）”。

**📋 结构：** more + adj. / more and more + adj.

**💡 用法：**
- 比较：A is more important than B.
- 趋势：It is becoming more and more important.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~It becomes more important. (想表达“越来越重要”)~~ → ✅ **It becomes more and more important.** (只写 more important 更像“更重要”，加 more and more 才是“越来越”。)

**📌 例句：**
- It becomes more and more important.
- This rule is more important than that one.

## 5. 时态表达：be getting + 形容词（表示变化）与 now 的冗余

**📝 定义：** be getting + adj. 常用来表达“正在变得……”。如果已经有 day by day（逐日变化），再加 now 往往显得重复。

**📋 结构：** be + getting + adj. (+ 时间/趋势状语)

**💡 用法：**
- The environment is getting worse day by day.
- 如果用 day by day，通常不必再加 now。

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~The environment is getting worse day by day now.~~ → ✅ **The environment is getting worse day by day.** (day by day 已经表达“现在这种持续变化”，now 容易显得多余。)

**📌 例句：**
- The weather is getting colder.
- The environment is getting worse day by day.

## 6. 句子连接：避免逗号拼接（comma splice），两句需要连接词

**📝 定义：** 英语中两个完整句子不能只用逗号硬拼在一起；通常需要并列连词（and/but/so）或从属连词（because/when/if）等。

**📋 结构：** 句子A + 连接词 + 句子B / 句子A; 句子B / 句子A. 句子B.

**💡 用法：**
- 并列：We should protect the environment, and it can make our lives better.
- 因果：We should protect the environment because it is important to everyone.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~We should protect the environment, make our life better.~~ → ✅ **We should protect the environment, and it can make our lives better.** (后半句缺主语且缺连接词；需要补主语并用连接词连接两句。)

**📌 例句：**
- We should protect the environment, and it can make our lives better.
- If everyone does it, the environment will be better.

## 7. 代词指代：it / them / this 要与前文对象一致

**📝 定义：** 代词必须清楚指向前面的对象；当提到多个事物时，用 them；指“这件事/这个做法”可用 this；只指单个对象才用 it。

**📋 结构：** it（单数）/ them（复数）/ this（这件事）

**💡 用法：**
- 两个做法（first/second）→ everyone can do them.
- 指“这种做法”→ everyone can do this.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~If everyone can do it, the environment will be better. (前面列了两个做法)~~ → ✅ **If everyone can do them, the environment will be better.** (前面是两个点（first/second），指代应为复数 them，或用 this 指“这些做法”。)

**📌 例句：**
- We can save energy and plant trees. If everyone can do them, the environment will be better.
- This can make our lives better.

## 8. 词汇辨析：tell / say / speak / talk（用法与固定搭配）

**📝 定义：** 这四个词都与“说”相关，但搭配与语法结构不同，必须按固定用法记忆；属于词汇辨析（归入语法理解）。

**📋 结构：** tell + 人 + 内容 / tell + 人 + to do；say + 内容；speak/talk + 介词搭配

**💡 用法：**
- tell somebody something：Tell me the truth.
- tell somebody to do something：He told me to go out.
- say something：He said sorry.
- talk about something：talk about the environment（谈论某事）
- talk with/to somebody：talk with/to you（与某人交谈）
- speak to somebody：speak to the teacher（更正式的“与……说话”）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~tell somebody doing something~~ → ✅ **tell somebody to do something** (tell 表“告诉某人去做某事”用 to do，不用 doing。)
- ❌ ~~talk something~~ → ✅ **talk about something** (talk 常用介词 about 才能接“谈论的内容”。)

**📌 例句：**
- He told me to turn off the light.
- We often talk about ways of protecting the environment.
- Please speak to your teacher after class.

## 9. 词汇辨析：speak vs say（方式/语言 vs 内容）

**📝 定义：** speak 更强调“说话的方式、能力或用某种语言说”；say 强调“说的内容是什么”。

**📋 结构：** speak + language / speak to somebody；say + 内容（从句/句子/话）

**💡 用法：**
- speak English：强调会用英语说话（不是把“English”这个词念出来）
- say + 从句：He said it would rain.（说的内容是“将要下雨”）
- 如果要“说出某个单词”，更贴近 say（说出内容）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~He speaks it will rain.~~ → ✅ **He said it would rain.** (表达“说的内容”用 say（said），不用 speak。)
- ❌ ~~I say English. (想表达“我会说英语”)~~ → ✅ **I speak English.** (表达“会用某种语言说话”用 speak + language。)

**📌 例句：**
- He said it would rain.
- She can speak English fluently.

## 10. 动词变形：过去式 vs 过去分词（功能区别）

**📝 定义：** 过去式主要用于一般过去时；过去分词用途更多：用于完成时、被动语态、以及作形容词/定语。

**📋 结构：** 过去式：V-ed/不规则V2；过去分词：V-ed/不规则V3

**💡 用法：**
- 一般过去时：I ate rice yesterday.（表示过去发生的动作）
- 现在完成时：have/has + 过去分词：I have eaten rice. / I have done my homework.
- 被动语态：be + 过去分词：The apple is eaten (by me).
- 过去分词作定语：the eaten apple（被吃的苹果）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I have did my homework.~~ → ✅ **I have done my homework.** (完成时必须用过去分词（V3），do 的 V3 是 done。)
- ❌ ~~The house is control by a system.~~ → ✅ **The house is controlled by a system.** (被动语态 be + 过去分词；control 的过去分词是 controlled。)

**📌 例句：**
- I did my homework yesterday.
- I have already done my homework.

## 11. 现在完成时：have/has + past participle

**📝 定义：** 现在完成时用来表达“已经完成/经历过”，常与 already, yet, ever, never 等连用。

**📋 结构：** have/has + V3（过去分词）

**💡 用法：**
- I have already done my homework.
- She has spoken to the teacher.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I have already did my homework.~~ → ✅ **I have already done my homework.** (have 后必须接过去分词（V3），不能接过去式（V2）。)

**📌 例句：**
- I have already done my homework.
- He has said sorry.

## 12. 被动语态：be + past participle（含 be 的多种形态）

**📝 定义：** 被动语态表示“主语是动作的承受者”。核心结构是 be + 过去分词；be 会随时态变化（am/is/are/was/were/been/being）。

**📋 结构：** be（am/is/are/was/were/been/being） + V3 (+ by + 执行者)

**💡 用法：**
- 现在一般被动：is/are + V3：The apple is eaten by me.
- 过去一般被动：was/were + V3：The apple was eaten by me.
- 完成时被动：have/has been + V3：The house has been controlled.
- 进行时被动：am/is/are being + V3：The house is being controlled.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~The apple is eat by me.~~ → ✅ **The apple is eaten by me.** (be 后必须用过去分词 eaten，而不是原形 eat。)

**📌 例句：**
- The apple is eaten by me.
- The house is being controlled by a central system.

## 13. 过去分词的三个常见用法总结

**📝 定义：** 过去分词（V3）不仅用于完成时，还用于被动语态，并且可像形容词一样修饰名词。

**📋 结构：** 1) have/has + V3；2) be + V3；3) V3 + noun / be + V3(adj.)

**💡 用法：**
- 完成：have eaten / have done
- 被动：is eaten / is controlled
- 作定语：the eaten apple / controlled system（语义上表示“被……”的）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~the eat apple (想表达“被吃的苹果”)~~ → ✅ **the eaten apple** (作定语需要用过去分词 eaten。)

**📌 例句：**
- I have eaten rice.
- The apple is eaten by me.
- the eaten apple

## 14. 不规则动词分类记忆：AAA / ABB / ABC

**📝 定义：** 不规则动词不按 -ed 变化，需要记 V2/V3。常见类型：AAA（三者相同）、ABB（后两者相同）、ABC（三者不同）。

**📋 结构：** V1 - V2 - V3（AAA/ABB/ABC）

**💡 用法：**
- AAA：cut-cut-cut；put-put-put；hit-hit-hit；cost-cost-cost；spread-spread-spread；hurt-hurt-hurt
- ABB：say-said-said；tell-told-told
- ABC：speak-spoke-spoken；do-did-done

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~speaked~~ → ✅ **spoke / spoken** (speak 是不规则动词：speak-spoke-spoken。)
- ❌ ~~doed~~ → ✅ **did / done** (do 是不规则动词：do-did-done。)

**📌 例句：**
- He spoke to me yesterday.
- He has spoken to me before.

## 15. 词汇辨析：speaker vs speech（避免语义跑偏）

**📝 定义：** speaker 通常指“演讲者/说话者/扬声器”；speech 指“演讲（名词）”。写作中要用对词性与含义。

**📋 结构：** speaker（人/设备名词）；speech（演讲名词）；give a speech（固定搭配）

**💡 用法：**
- give a speech：做演讲
- in front of a crowd：在人群面前（常与 give a speech 连用）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Give a speaker in front of a crowd.~~ → ✅ **Give a speech in front of a crowd.** (speaker 不是“演讲”，speech 才是“演讲（名词）”。)

**📌 例句：**
- Giving a speech in front of a crowd makes me nervous.
- The speaker was confident.

## 16. ask 的三种核心结构：ask sb to do / ask for / ask sb for

**📝 定义：** ask 的含义会随结构变化：ask sb to do 表“要求/请求某人做”；ask for 表“请求某物”；ask sb for 表“向某人要某物”。

**📋 结构：** ask somebody to do something / ask for something / ask somebody for something

**💡 用法：**
- ask somebody to do something：He asked me to plan the meal.
- ask for something：She asked for help.
- ask somebody for something：I asked him for advice.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~ask somebody something (想表达“要求某人做某事”)~~ → ✅ **ask somebody to do something** (要求别人去做，用 to do 结构更标准。)

**📌 例句：**
- He asked me to help him.
- I asked her for a pen.

## 17. 长句翻译技巧：先找介词/连词，从后往前拆分

**📝 定义：** 英语长句往往因为介词短语或连词结构变长；翻译时先找介词/连词，把“增加的部分”先抽出来，再从后往前组织中文。

**📋 结构：** 主干（主语+谓语+宾语/表语） + 介词短语/从句（修饰成分）

**💡 用法：**
- 先抽修饰：in science class / for a successful experiment
- 再翻主干：Proper preparation is essential
- 组合：在科学课上，对于一个成功的实验来说，合适的准备非常重要。

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~合适的准备是重要的对于一个成功的实验在科学课上。~~ → ✅ **在科学课上，对于一个成功的实验来说，合适的准备非常重要。** (先处理介词短语（in..., for...），再翻主干更顺畅。)

**📌 例句：**
- Proper preparation is essential for a successful experiment in science class.
- In science class, proper preparation is essential for a successful experiment.

## 18. 动名词（V-ing）作主语：整体作主语

**📝 定义：** 动词加 -ing 变成动名词短语后可作主语，表示“一件事/一个动作”，作为整体看待。

**📋 结构：** V-ing（短语） + 谓语 + ...

**💡 用法：**
- Giving a speech can make people nervous.
- Sharing ideas online is helpful.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Give a speech make me nervous.~~ → ✅ **Giving a speech makes me nervous.** (作主语需要用动名词短语 Giving a speech，并注意主谓一致。)

**📌 例句：**
- Giving a speech in front of a crowd is difficult.
- Learning a foreign language takes time.

## 19. 介词后面接什么：介词 + 名词/动名词，不接动词原形或过去式

**📝 定义：** 介词后面通常接名词或动名词（V-ing）；不能直接接动词原形或过去式。to do 里的 to 不算普通介词（是动词不定式标记）。

**📋 结构：** preposition + noun / preposition + V-ing

**💡 用法：**
- into management（介词 into + 名词）
- without saying goodbye（without + 动名词）
- for a successful experiment（for + 名词短语）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~into manage~~ → ✅ **into management** (into 后要跟名词；manage 是动词，需变名词 management。)
- ❌ ~~without say goodbye~~ → ✅ **without saying goodbye** (without 后可接动名词 V-ing。)

**📌 例句：**
- Women should get into management.
- He left without saying goodbye.

## 20. 词性变化：动词变名词的常见后缀 -ment / -er

**📝 定义：** 英语中动词可以通过加后缀变成名词：-ment 表“行为/结果/领域”，-er 表“做这件事的人”。

**📋 结构：** verb + -ment → noun；verb + -er → person noun

**💡 用法：**
- manage → management（管理）
- manage → manager（经理/管理者）
- prepare → preparation（准备）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~into manage~~ → ✅ **into management** (介词后需要名词，常用 -ment 构词。)

**📌 例句：**
- Management is important in a company.
- The manager is responsible.

## 21. see 的两种宾补结构：see sb do vs see sb doing

**📝 定义：** see somebody do something 强调“看见全过程/事实”；see somebody doing something 强调“看见正在发生”。

**📋 结构：** see + sb + do；see + sb + doing

**💡 用法：**
- see sb do：I saw him speak English fluently.（强调他会说/事实）
- see sb doing：I saw him speaking English.（强调当时正在说）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I saw him to speak English.~~ → ✅ **I saw him speak English.** (see 的宾补结构不用 to。)

**📌 例句：**
- I saw her cross the road.
- I saw her crossing the road.

## 22. invite 的固定结构：invite sb to do（不接 doing）

**📝 定义：** invite 表“邀请某人去做某事”，结构固定为 invite somebody to do something；不能用 invite somebody doing。

**📋 结构：** invite somebody to do something

**💡 用法：**
- They invited me to join the club.
- She invited him to have dinner.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~They invited me joining the club.~~ → ✅ **They invited me to join the club.** (邀请是“还没发生的动作”，用 to do 表目的/将要做。)

**📌 例句：**
- He invited us to visit his home.
- She invited me to speak.

## 23. 称呼用法：Miss / Mrs. / Ms.（婚姻状况与正式程度）

**📝 定义：** Miss 用于未婚女性；Mrs. 用于已婚女性；Ms. 更中性，常用于不确定或不强调婚姻状况的女性称呼。

**📋 结构：** Miss + 姓；Mrs. + 姓；Ms. + 姓

**💡 用法：**
- Miss Liu：刘老师（未婚或常规课堂称呼）
- Mrs. Smith：史密斯太太（已婚）
- Ms. Liu：刘老师（不强调婚姻状况）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Mr. Liu (指女性老师)~~ → ✅ **Miss Liu / Ms. Liu** (Mr. 仅用于男性；女性用 Miss/Mrs./Ms.。)

**📌 例句：**
- Miss Liu asked us to be quiet in class.
- Ms. Wang teaches English.

## 24. 初中高频语法清单：时态 + 被动（考试核心）

**📝 定义：** 初中语法高频考点集中在：常见时态（一般现在/过去/将来；现在进行；现在完成等）以及被动语态结构（be + V3）。掌握定义与结构即可快速做题。

**📋 结构：** 时态：按助动词/动词形式变化；被动：be + V3

**💡 用法：**
- 一般过去：V2（I did）
- 现在完成：have/has + V3（I have done）
- 被动语态：be + V3（is done / was done）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~have + V2~~ → ✅ **have + V3** (现在完成时 have/has 后必须接过去分词。)

**📌 例句：**
- I have finished my work.
- The homework is finished.

## 25. to do vs to doing：不定式后用动词原形

**📝 定义：** 动词不定式结构是 to + 动词原形（base form）；to doing 一般不成立（除非 to 是介词，但那是另一种结构）。

**📋 结构：** to + verb (base form)

**💡 用法：**
- ask somebody to do something：要求/请求某人做某事
- invite somebody to do something：邀请某人做某事
- need/want/hope to do something：需要/想要/希望做某事

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~ask somebody to doing something~~ → ✅ **ask somebody to do something** (to do 里的 to 是不定式标记，后接动词原形。)

**📌 例句：**
- Miss Liu asked us to be quiet.
- They invited me to join the club.

## 26. 介词用法：without 后接名词或动名词（V-ing）

**📝 定义：** without 是介词，后面不能直接跟动词原形；可接名词或 V-ing（动名词）。

**📋 结构：** without + noun / without + V-ing

**💡 用法：**
- without a word（没有一句话）
- without saying goodbye（没有说再见）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~without say goodbye~~ → ✅ **without saying goodbye** (介词后接动名词 V-ing。)

**📌 例句：**
- He left without saying goodbye.
- She finished the task without help.

## 27. 一般疑问句变换：优先提前 be / 情态动词 / 助动词

**📝 定义：** 把陈述句变一般疑问句时：若句中有 be（am/is/are/was/were）或情态动词（can/should...）或完成时 have/has，直接提前；若没有，则借助 do/does/did。

**📋 结构：** 1) Be/Modal/Have + 主语 + ...? 2) Do/Does/Did + 主语 + 动词原形 + ...?

**💡 用法：**
- I am Jim. → Are you Jim?
- He has finished. → Has he finished?
- She likes apples. → Does she like apples?
- They played soccer. → Did they play soccer?

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Do you are Jim?~~ → ✅ **Are you Jim?** (有 be 动词时直接提前 be，不用 do。)

**📌 例句：**
- Is this your book?
- Do you like English?

## 28. do / does / did 的选择：看时态与主语（三单）

**📝 定义：** 一般疑问句/否定句使用 do 系列：一般现在时用 do/does；一般过去时用 did。一般现在时中，第三人称单数用 does，其余用 do。

**📋 结构：** do（I/you/we/they）; does（he/she/it/单数名词）; did（过去时）

**💡 用法：**
- 动词原形 → do：They make... → Do they make...?
- 三单动词（-s/-es）→ does：He makes... → Does he make...?
- 过去式 → did：He made... → Did he make...?

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Do he like apples?~~ → ✅ **Does he like apples?** (he 是第三人称单数，用 does。)
- ❌ ~~Does they make it?~~ → ✅ **Do they make it?** (they 不是三单，用 do。)

**📌 例句：**
- Does the oven tell you the time?
- Did you finish your homework?

## 29. 第三人称单数（三单）到底是什么

**📝 定义：** “三单”= 第三人称单数，不是“三个单”。指 he/she/it 或单数名词作主语时，一般现在时谓语动词加 -s/-es。

**📋 结构：** he/she/it/单数名词 + V-s/V-es（一般现在时）

**💡 用法：**
- The oven tells us ...（oven 单数 → tells）
- He goes to school. / She studies hard.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~The oven tell us ...~~ → ✅ **The oven tells us ...** (The oven 是第三人称单数，一般现在时动词要加 -s。)

**📌 例句：**
- It works well.
- My father drives to work.

## 30. 疑问句类型与语调：一般/特殊/选择疑问句

**📝 定义：** 一般疑问句（Yes/No）常用升调；特殊疑问句（Wh-）多用降调；选择疑问句在 or 前升调，or 后降调。

**📋 结构：** 一般：Be/Do... ?；特殊：Wh- + 一般疑问句语序；选择：A or B?

**💡 用法：**
- 一般：Is this your book?（升）
- 特殊：Whose book is this?（降）
- 选择：Is this an apple or an orange?（apple ↑ / orange ↓）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Whose book is this?（用成明显升调）~~ → ✅ **Whose book is this?（更自然用降调）** (特殊疑问句通常用降调表达完整询问。)

**📌 例句：**
- Is this your book?
- Is it tea or coffee?

## 31. 否定句：doesn't have 而不是 hasn't（一般现在的否定）

**📝 定义：** have 在一般现在时做实义动词时，否定要借助 do/does：don't/doesn't have。hasn't 常用于 have 作助动词（完成时）或英式用法中特定结构。

**📋 结构：** subject + don't/doesn't + have + ...

**💡 用法：**
- He doesn't have any time.
- She doesn't have anything to say.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~He hasn't any books. (在一般现在语境下想表达“没有”)~~ → ✅ **He doesn't have any books.** (把 have 当实义动词时，用 do/does 构成否定更标准。)
- ❌ ~~He doesn't have some books.~~ → ✅ **He doesn't have any books.** (否定句和疑问句里通常用 any 代替 some。)

**📌 例句：**
- He doesn't have any money.
- Does she have any sisters?

## 32. 画线部分提问：先确定问什么，再把其余部分变一般疑问句

**📝 定义：** 对画线部分提问：第一步确定画线部分的性质（人/物/时间/地点/原因等），选对应 Wh- 疑问词；第二步把没画线的部分改成一般疑问句语序。

**📋 结构：** Wh- word + 一般疑问句语序（be/情态/have 提前；否则 do/does/did）

**💡 用法：**
- 画线是名词宾语 → 用 what：The oven tells us the time. → What does the oven tell us?
- 画线是时间 → 用 when：We eat at 8. → When do you eat?

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~What the oven tells us?~~ → ✅ **What does the oven tell us?** (特殊疑问句中，除了疑问词外，其余部分要用一般疑问句语序（缺助动词要加 do/does/did）。)

**📌 例句：**
- What does the oven tell us?
- Where do you live?

## 33. 一般疑问句复述：优先提前已有的“头”，没有就借助 do/does/did

**📝 定义：** 陈述句变一般疑问句：句中若有 be/情态动词/助动词（如 have/has），直接提前；若没有，就在句首加 do/does/did，并把实义动词变回原形。

**📋 结构：** Be/Modal/Have + 主语 + ...? / Do/Does/Did + 主语 + 动词原形 + ...?

**💡 用法：**
- 原句动词原形（一般现在）→ 用 do：They waste food. → Do they waste food?
- 原句动词三单（一般现在）→ 用 does：He wastes food. → Does he waste food?
- 原句动词过去式（一般过去）→ 用 did：They wasted food. → Did they waste food?

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Does they waste food?~~ → ✅ **Do they waste food?** (they 不是第三人称单数，用 do，不用 does。)

**📌 例句：**
- Do you like English?
- Did she go to school yesterday?

## 34. do/does/did 的快速判断：看原句动词形态

**📝 定义：** 判断用 do/does/did 的快捷法：看原句谓语动词是原形/三单/过去式。原形→do；三单→does；过去式→did。

**📋 结构：** 原形→do；三单(-s/-es)→does；过去式(V2)→did

**💡 用法：**
- make（原形）→ Do ... make ...?
- makes（三单）→ Does ... make ...?
- made（过去式）→ Did ... make ...?

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Do he makes ...?~~ → ✅ **Does he make ...?** (三单陈述句变疑问句：用 does，同时动词去掉 -s 还原为原形。)

**📌 例句：**
- Does the oven tell us the time?
- Did they finish the work?

## 35. 介词合并句：without 合并时，后句去主语并用动名词（V-ing）

**📝 定义：** 用 without 把两句合并：without 是介词，后面要接名词或 V-ing；合并时通常把后一句的主语省略（若与前句主语一致），并把动词改为 V-ing。

**📋 结构：** 句子A + without + V-ing + ...

**💡 用法：**
- The smart kitchen can cook meals without wasting any food.
- They left without saying goodbye.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~The smart kitchen can cook meals without they waste food.~~ → ✅ **The smart kitchen can cook meals without wasting any food.** (without 后不能接完整句；要省略主语并把动词变 V-ing。)

**📌 例句：**
- He went out without locking the door.
- She finished the task without asking for help.

## 36. and 合并句：主语相同可省略后句主语（并列结构）

**📝 定义：** 用 and 连接两句时，如果两句主语相同，后一句主语可以省略以避免重复；and 连接的是并列成分或并列分句。

**📋 结构：** 主语 + 谓语A + ... and + 谓语B + ...（省略重复主语）

**💡 用法：**
- They can cook meals and (they) never waste any food.
- Apples are tasty and (they are) green.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~They can cook meals and never wastes food.~~ → ✅ **They can cook meals and never waste food.** (并列结构中动词形式要与主语一致；waste 与 they 搭配用原形。)

**📌 例句：**
- He opened the window and looked outside.
- She studied hard and passed the exam.

## 37. 阅读定位策略：先读题目，抓名词关键词，再做“交叉定位”

**📝 定义：** 做阅读题不一定通读全文：先读题干，提取稳定不易变的名词关键词（人名、地点、时间、专有名词），回文中找同词或同义词；多个信息点交叉出现的位置往往就是答案区。

**📋 结构：** 题干关键词A + 关键词B → 文中交叉点 → 答案区

**💡 用法：**
- 题干：young people + USA + volunteer → 先找 USA/young people/volunteer 位置
- 题干：Alice + summer → 先找 Alice，再在附近找 summer

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~只凭感觉选项不回文定位~~ → ✅ **先找题干关键词，再回文验证** (阅读题多数答案在原文可定位，靠猜容易失分。)

**📌 例句：**
- Look for names and places first.
- Then match the keywords with the options.

## 38. 词汇辨析：volunteer（名词/动词）与 spend（核心义是“花费”）

**📝 定义：** volunteer 既可作名词“志愿者”，也可作动词“自愿/志愿做”；spend 的底层含义是“花费”，花费时间可引申为“度过”。

**📋 结构：** volunteer to do something；spend time/money doing something

**💡 用法：**
- They volunteer to help others.
- They spend time helping others.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~They spend helping others.~~ → ✅ **They spend time helping others.** (spend 后需要明确花费的对象：time/money。)

**📌 例句：**
- Many students volunteer to clean the park.
- He spends money buying books.

## 39. 发音规律提醒：名词/动词拼写仅差 e，读音常变化

**📝 定义：** 部分词名词和动词形式只差一个结尾 e，但读音会变化：bath/bathe，breath/breathe；考试和听力都可能考到。

**📋 结构：** noun（无 e）/ verb（加 e）

**💡 用法：**
- bath /bæθ/ → bathe /beɪð/
- breath /breθ/ → breathe /briːð/

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I need to breath.~~ → ✅ **I need to breathe.** (动词“呼吸”是 breathe（有 e），breath（无 e）是名词。)

**📌 例句：**
- Take a deep breath.
- Breathe deeply and relax.

## 40. 不规则动词复习：grow-grew-grown（V2/V3 要记）

**📝 定义：** grow 是不规则动词，过去式 grew，过去分词 grown；完成时或被动需要用过去分词 grown。

**📋 结构：** grow - grew - grown

**💡 用法：**
- 一般过去：Plants grew quickly.
- 现在完成：Plants have grown quickly.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Plants have grew quickly.~~ → ✅ **Plants have grown quickly.** (have/has 后要用过去分词（V3）grown。)

**📌 例句：**
- The tree grew taller last year.
- The tree has grown a lot.

## 41. 阅读交叉定位：两条信息交叉处就是答案区

**📝 定义：** 当题干给出两个信息点（如人物+时间/地点），需要在原文中分别定位两者，然后寻找它们的交叉区域；答案通常就在交叉点附近，而不是只找到其中一个信息点就选。

**📋 结构：** 关键词A定位 + 关键词B定位 → 交叉点/重叠段落 → 找同义替换/答案句

**💡 用法：**
- 题干：Alice + summer → 先找 Alice 段，再在其附近找 summer；两者交叉的句子就是答案句
- 题干：USA + young people + volunteer → 先找 USA/young people，再找 volunteer，交叉处即答案区

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~只找到 Alice 就直接选答案~~ → ✅ **Alice 定位后必须再找 summer，并在交叉处找答案句** (题干双信息必须交叉验证，否则容易误选附近干扰项。)

**📌 例句：**
- The answer is near where the two keywords meet.
- Find 'Alice' first, then find 'summer' in the same area.

## 42. 宾语从句：that/wh- 引导的从句在句中作宾语

**📝 定义：** 当 that/what/when/where/why/how 等出现在句中间并引导一个完整句子时，这个从句常作动词的宾语，叫宾语从句。

**📋 结构：** verb + (that/wh-) + clause

**💡 用法：**
- We know (that) Jason is 18.
- We know from the passage that Jason is 18.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~把 that 当作“那个”去翻译成形容词修饰人名（如 that Jason）~~ → ✅ **把 that 识别为连词，引导后面的完整句子** (人名前一般不加 that/this 去修饰；在阅读中 that 多数是连词或关系词。)

**📌 例句：**
- I think that he is right.
- She knows what you want.

## 43. 后置定语：修饰名词的成分放在名词后面

**📝 定义：** 英语里当修饰成分较长或为短语/从句时，常放在被修饰名词后面，叫后置定语。后置定语本质是“定语”，修饰名词。

**📋 结构：** noun + (prepositional phrase / relative clause / participle phrase)

**💡 用法：**
- 介词短语作后置定语：the apples on the tree
- 定语从句作后置定语：families that are not rich

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~把后置定语当成另一个名词或当成副词~~ → ✅ **先确定它在句中是“修饰名词”的成分=定语** (后置定语的核心任务是修饰名词，回答“哪个/什么样的”。)

**📌 例句：**
- The man in the hat is my uncle.
- The book that you bought is interesting.

## 44. 定语从句：that 引导从句修饰前面的名词

**📝 定义：** that 引导的从句如果用来修饰前面某个名词（先行词），这个从句叫定语从句；that 在从句中可作主语或宾语等成分。

**📋 结构：** noun + that + clause

**💡 用法：**
- families that are not rich（that 从句修饰 families）
- the person that teaches people（that 从句修饰 person）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~看到 that 就一律当宾语从句~~ → ✅ **看 that 前面的词：若是名词且 that 从句修饰它→定语从句；若 that 从句作动词宾语→宾语从句** (判断从句类型的关键是看 that 前的“依附对象”与句中功能。)

**📌 例句：**
- I like the book that you recommended.
- Families that are not rich need help.

## 45. The + 形容词：表示“一类人”（词汇辨析归入语法）

**📝 定义：** the + 形容词可以把形容词名词化，表示“某一类人”，常作复数意义（整体群体）。

**📋 结构：** the + adjective → a group of people

**💡 用法：**
- the rich（富人）
- the old（老人）
- the young（年轻人）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~the rich 翻成“富有的（某个东西）”~~ → ✅ **the rich 翻成“富人（这一类人）”** (the + adj 在语法上名词化，指人群而非单个物品。)

**📌 例句：**
- The rich are not always happy.
- The young need more opportunities.

## 46. 特殊疑问句对宾语提问：what + do/does + 主语 + 动词原形

**📝 定义：** 当画线部分是动词的宾语（东西/内容）时，用 what 提问；句子其余部分按一般疑问句语序（缺助动词就加 do/does）。

**📋 结构：** What + do/does + subject + verb (base form) ...?

**💡 用法：**
- He teaches people how to build houses. → What does he teach people?
- They sell houses to families. → What do they sell to families?

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~What he teaches people?~~ → ✅ **What does he teach people?** (特殊疑问句=疑问词+一般疑问句语序；无助动词要补 do/does。)

**📌 例句：**
- What do you want?
- What does she need?

## 47. 双宾语结构：teach 的两个宾语（人 + 物/内容）

**📝 定义：** 部分动词可接两个宾语：一个是“人”（间接宾语），一个是“物/内容”（直接宾语）。teach 常用 teach sb sth 或 teach sb how to do sth。

**📋 结构：** teach + sb + sth / teach + sb + how to do sth

**💡 用法：**
- He teaches people skills.
- He teaches people how to build houses.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~He teaches to people how to build houses.~~ → ✅ **He teaches people how to build houses.** (teach 后可直接接人作宾语，不需要 to。)

**📌 例句：**
- She taught me English.
- They teach children how to read.

## 48. 从句判断技巧：优先看从句前面的名词（最近修饰原则）

**📝 定义：** 判断从句类型时，先看从句前紧挨着的词：如果是名词且从句用于说明它，多为定语从句；并且从句通常优先修饰最近的那个名词，避免“同时修饰两个名词”的歧义。

**📋 结构：** noun1 noun2 + clause → 通常修饰 noun2（最近名词）

**💡 用法：**
- families that are not rich：that 从句修饰 families
- the apples on the tree：on the tree 修饰 apples

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~认为一个从句同时修饰两个名词~~ → ✅ **默认修饰最近名词；若要修饰更远名词需改写** (英语倾向表达准确，避免模糊修饰范围。)

**📌 例句：**
- The student in the classroom is my brother.
- The car that he bought is new.

## 49. 最近修饰原则（定语从句/后置定语）

**📝 定义：** 修饰成分通常修饰离它最近的名词，不能跨越去修饰更远的名词。

**📋 结构：** noun + modifier (phrase / clause)

**💡 用法：**
- children with trouble in reading（修饰 children）
- the apples on the tree（修饰 apples）

**📌 例句：**
- The students in the classroom are quiet.
- Children with trouble in reading need help.

## 50. 定语从句与介词短语作后置定语的区别

**📝 定义：** 后置定语可以是定语从句，也可以是介词短语，但二者结构不同。

**📋 结构：** 定语从句：noun + that/which/who + clause,介词短语：noun + preposition + noun

**📌 例句：**
- families that are not rich（定语从句）
- children with trouble in reading（介词短语）

## 51. 翻译顺序原则：是否从后往前翻

**📝 定义：** 只有在句子中出现介词、连词、从句等导致结构变长、难以直译时，才需要从后往前翻译。

**💡 用法：**
- 简单句：按正常顺序翻译
- 复杂句：先翻介词短语或从句，再回到主干

**📌 例句：**
- He teaches children.（正序）
- He teaches children with trouble in reading.（先翻后置定语）

## 52. 动名词作主语

**📝 定义：** 动词 + -ing 形式可以作主语，表示“一件事/一种行为”，整体视为单数。

**📋 结构：** V-ing + 谓语动词（第三人称单数）

**📌 例句：**
- Reading books makes people better.
- Doing exercise helps your health.

## 53. 主语逻辑判断：行为 vs 事物

**📝 定义：** 英语中需明确主语是“行为”还是“事物”，以决定谓语形式和句意。

**📌 例句：**
- Reading books makes people better.（行为作主语）
- Books make people better.（事物作主语）

## 54. 三单判断的核心原则

**📝 定义：** 判断谓语是否加 -s 的关键不是名词是否复数，而是主语整体是否是第三人称单数。

**📌 例句：**
- Reading books makes progress.
- The book makes progress.

# 📖 语法知识

## 1. 不定式 (to + 动词原形)

**📝 定义：** 由to + 动词原形构成的非谓语动词形式，可以作主语、宾语、表语、定语、状语和宾语补足语。

**📋 结构：** to + 动词原形

**💡 用法：**
- 作宾语：I want to go home. / I decide to study hard.
- 作目的状语：I came here to see you.
- 作主语：To learn English well is important. = It is important to learn English well.
- 作宾语补足语：My mother asked me to clean the room.
- 作定语：I have something to tell you.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I want go home.~~ → ✅ **I want to go home.** (want后接不定式，必须有to)
- ❌ ~~He made me to cry.~~ → ✅ **He made me cry.** (make/let/have等使役动词后用省略to的不定式)
- ❌ ~~I saw him to run.~~ → ✅ **I saw him run/running.** (感官动词see/hear/watch后用省略to的不定式或-ing)

**📌 例句：**
- She decided to become a doctor.
- It's kind of you to help me.
- I don't know what to do.

## 2. 一般现在时

**📝 定义：** 表示经常性、习惯性的动作或状态，也用于表示客观事实、真理和现在的状态。

**📋 结构：** 主语 + 动词原形（第三人称单数加-s/-es）

**💡 用法：**
- 表示经常性或习惯性动作：I get up at 6 every day.
- 表示客观事实或真理：The earth goes around the sun.
- 表示现在的状态或特征：She looks beautiful.
- 在时间/条件状语从句中表将来：If it rains tomorrow, I will stay at home.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~He go to school every day.~~ → ✅ **He goes to school every day.** (第三人称单数主语后，动词要加-s或-es)
- ❌ ~~She don't like apples.~~ → ✅ **She doesn't like apples.** (第三人称单数的否定用doesn't，不用don't)

**📌 例句：**
- I usually have breakfast at 7:00.
- She speaks English very well.
- Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius.

## 3. 现在进行时

**📝 定义：** 表示现在正在进行的动作，也可表示现阶段正在进行或即将发生的动作。

**📋 结构：** 主语 + am/is/are + 动词-ing

**💡 用法：**
- 表示说话时正在进行的动作：He is reading a book now.
- 表示现阶段正在进行的动作：She is learning French this year.
- 表示即将发生的动作（常用go, come, leave等）：I am leaving tomorrow.
- 与always连用表示赞扬或不满：He is always helping others.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~She is play the piano.~~ → ✅ **She is playing the piano.** (be动词后面要用动词的-ing形式)
- ❌ ~~I am knowing the answer.~~ → ✅ **I know the answer.** (know是状态动词，一般不用进行时)

**📌 例句：**
- They are watching TV at the moment.
- Look! The baby is crying.
- We are having an English class now.

## 4. 主谓一致

**📝 定义：** 句子的主语和谓语动词在人称和数上要保持一致。

**📋 结构：** 单数主语 + 单数谓语 / 复数主语 + 复数谓语

**💡 用法：**
- 就近原则：There is/are..., Either...or..., Neither...nor..., Not only...but also...
- 就远原则：主语 + with/as well as/together with/except/besides + 名词
- 不可数名词作主语，谓语用单数：Water is important.
- 动名词/不定式作主语，谓语用单数：Swimming is good for health.
- 集体名词：family, class, team等看作整体用单数，看作成员用复数

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~The teacher with his students are in the classroom.~~ → ✅ **The teacher with his students is in the classroom.** (with引导的部分不是主语，主语是teacher，谓语用单数)
- ❌ ~~Neither you nor he are right.~~ → ✅ **Neither you nor he is right.** (neither...nor...就近原则，he是单数，用is)
- ❌ ~~Maths are my favorite subject.~~ → ✅ **Maths is my favorite subject.** (学科名词（maths, physics, news等）虽以s结尾，但作单数)

**📌 例句：**
- Everyone is here.
- Not only he but also I am a student.

## 5. 宾语从句

**💡 用法：**
- that引导（可省略）：I think (that) he is right.
- wh-词引导：I don't know what his name is.
- if/whether引导：I wonder if/whether he will come.
- 注意宾语从句要用陈述语序

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I don't know where is he.~~ → ✅ **I don't know where he is.** (宾语从句要用陈述语序，不用疑问语序)
- ❌ ~~He asked me that where I lived.~~ → ✅ **He asked me where I lived.** (特殊疑问词引导时不需要that)
- ❌ ~~I wonder if will he come.~~ → ✅ **I wonder if he will come.** (if引导的宾语从句要用陈述语序)

- I didn't watch TV last night.

## 7. 现在完成时

**📝 定义：** 表示过去发生的动作对现在造成的影响或结果，也表示从过去持续到现在的动作或状态。

**📋 结构：** 主语 + have/has + 过去分词

**💡 用法：**
- 表示过去的动作对现在的影响：I have lost my key. (现在没有钥匙)
- 表示经历：Have you ever been to Beijing?
- 表示持续到现在的状态：I have lived here for 10 years.
- 常与already, yet, just, ever, never, for, since连用

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I have see the movie.~~ → ✅ **I have seen the movie.** (have/has后面要用动词的过去分词形式)
- ❌ ~~I have bought this book yesterday.~~ → ✅ **I bought this book yesterday.** (有具体过去时间（yesterday），不能用现在完成时)
- ❌ ~~He has gone to Beijing for 3 days.~~ → ✅ **He has been in Beijing for 3 days.** (have gone表示去了还没回来，不能与for连用)

**📌 例句：**
- She has already finished her homework.
- I have never met him before.
- We have known each other since 2020.

## 8. 被动语态

**📝 定义：** 当主语是动作的承受者时，使用被动语态。强调动作的承受者或动作本身。

**📋 结构：** 主语 + be + 过去分词 + (by + 动作执行者)

**💡 用法：**
- 不知道或不必说明动作执行者：The window was broken.
- 强调动作承受者：The book was written by Lu Xun.
- 客观报道或正式场合：The meeting will be held tomorrow.
- 各种时态的被动：is done, was done, will be done, has been done等

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~The car was repair yesterday.~~ → ✅ **The car was repaired yesterday.** (be后面要用动词的过去分词)
- ❌ ~~The book is belonged to me.~~ → ✅ **The book belongs to me.** (belong是不及物动词，没有被动语态)

**📌 例句：**

## 9. 一般疑问句

**📝 定义：** 用yes或no回答的疑问句，通常将助动词、be动词或情态动词放在主语前。

**📋 结构：** 助动词/Be动词/情态动词 + 主语 + 动词(原形) + 其他?

**💡 用法：**

- 助动词开头：Do you like English? — Yes, I do. / No, I don't.
- 情态动词开头：Can you swim? — Yes, I can. / No, I can't.
- 回答要与问句保持一致

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Does he likes music?~~ → ✅ **Does he like music?** (does后面动词要用原形)
- ❌ ~~Are you a teacher? — Yes, you are.~~ → ✅ **Are you a teacher? — Yes, I am.** (回答时主语要变换，you变I)
- ❌ ~~Do you can swim?~~ → ✅ **Can you swim?** (情态动词can不能与do连用)

- Will it rain tomorrow? — Maybe.

## 10. 特殊疑问句

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~What you want?~~ → ✅ **What do you want?** (特殊疑问句需要助动词（疑问词作主语时除外）)
- ❌ ~~Who did break the window?~~ → ✅ **Who broke the window?** (who作主语时，不需要助动词did)
- ❌ ~~How many book do you have?~~ → ✅ **How many books do you have?** (how many后面要用可数名词复数)

**📌 例句：**
- What time does the movie start?
- Who teaches you English?
- How often do you exercise?

## 11. 定语从句

**📝 定义：** 在复合句中修饰名词或代词的从句，通常紧跟在被修饰的词（先行词）之后。

**📋 结构：** 先行词 + 关系词(who/which/that/whose/where/when) + 从句

**💡 用法：**
- who/that指人：The man who/that is talking is my father.
- which/that指物：The book which/that I bought is interesting.
- whose表所属：The girl whose mother is a doctor is my friend.
- where指地点：This is the school where I studied.
- when指时间：I still remember the day when I met you.

**⚠️ 易错点：**

- ❌ ~~The book who I bought is good.~~ → ✅ **The book which/that I bought is good.** (先行词是物时，用which或that，不用who)
- ❌ ~~This is the place where I visited.~~ → ✅ **This is the place which/that I visited.** (visit是及物动词，需要宾语，用which/that而非where)

**📌 例句：**
- I have a friend who can speak five languages.
- The movie that we saw last night was exciting.
- I'll never forget the day when I graduated.

## 12. 后置定语

**📝 定义：** 后置定语是指放在被修饰名词之后的修饰成分，用来对名词进行补充说明。

**💡 用法：**
- 当定语较长或为短语、从句时使用
- 常见形式有介词短语、定语从句

# 📖 语法

## 1. 现在完成时

**📝 定义：** 表示过去发生的动作对现在造成的影响或结果，也表示从过去持续到现在的动作或状态。

**📋 结构：** 主语 + have/has + 过去分词

**💡 用法：**
- 表示过去的动作对现在的影响：I have lost my key. (现在没有钥匙)
- 表示经历：Have you ever been to Beijing?
- 表示持续到现在的状态：I have lived here for 10 years.
- 常与already, yet, just, ever, never, for, since连用

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I have see the movie.~~ → ✅ **I have seen the movie.** (have/has后面要用动词的过去分词形式)
- ❌ ~~I have bought this book yesterday.~~ → ✅ **I bought this book yesterday.** (有具体过去时间（yesterday），不能用现在完成时)
- ❌ ~~He has gone to Beijing for 3 days.~~ → ✅ **He has been in Beijing for 3 days.** (have gone表示去了还没回来，不能与for连用)

**📌 例句：**
- She has already finished her homework.
- I have never met him before.
- We have known each other since 2020.

## 2. 被动语态

**📝 定义：** 当主语是动作的承受者时，使用被动语态。强调动作的承受者或动作本身。

**📋 结构：** 主语 + be + 过去分词 + (by + 动作执行者)

**💡 用法：**
- 不知道或不必说明动作执行者：The window was broken.
- 强调动作承受者：The book was written by Lu Xun.
- 客观报道或正式场合：The meeting will be held tomorrow.
- 各种时态的被动：is done, was done, will be done, has been done等

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~The car was repair yesterday.~~ → ✅ **The car was repaired yesterday.** (be后面要用动词的过去分词)
- ❌ ~~The book is belonged to me.~~ → ✅ **The book belongs to me.** (belong是不及物动词，没有被动语态)

**📌 例句：**
- English is spoken all over the world.
- The bridge was built in 1990.
- The work must be finished on time.

## 3. make

**📝 定义：** 使役动词

**📋 结构：** make的使役用法

## 4. 不定式

**📝 定义：** 由to + 动词原形构成的非谓语动词形式，可以作主语、宾语、表语、定语、状语和宾语补足语。

**📋 结构：** to + 动词原形

**💡 用法：**
- 作宾语：I want to go home. / I decide to study hard.
- 作目的状语：I came here to see you.
- 作主语：To learn English well is important. = It is important to learn English well.
- 作宾语补足语：My mother asked me to clean the room.
- 作定语：I have something to tell you.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I want go home.~~ → ✅ **I want to go home.** (want后接不定式，必须有to)
- ❌ ~~He made me to cry.~~ → ✅ **He made me cry.** (make/let/have等使役动词后用省略to的不定式)
- ❌ ~~I saw him to run.~~ → ✅ **I saw him run/running.** (感官动词see/hear/watch后用省略to的不定式或-ing)

**📌 例句：**
- She decided to become a doctor.
- It's kind of you to help me.
- I don't know what to do.

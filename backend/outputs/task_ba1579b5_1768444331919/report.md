# 📖 语法

## 1. 不定式 (to + 动词原形)

**📝 定义：** 由to + 动词原形构成的非谓语动词形式，可以作主语、宾语、表语、定语、状语和宾语补足语。

**📋 结构：** to + 动词原形

**💡 用法：**
- 作宾语：I want to go home. / I decide to study hard.
- 作目的状语：I came here to see you.
- 作主语：To learn English well is important. = It is important to learn English well.
- 作宾语补足语：My mother asked me to clean the room.
- 作定语：I have something to tell you.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I want go home.~~ → ✅ **I want to go home.** (want后接不定式，必须有to)
- ❌ ~~He made me to cry.~~ → ✅ **He made me cry.** (make/let/have等使役动词后用省略to的不定式)
- ❌ ~~I saw him to run.~~ → ✅ **I saw him run/running.** (感官动词see/hear/watch后用省略to的不定式或-ing)

**📌 例句：**
- She decided to become a doctor.
- It's kind of you to help me.
- I don't know what to do.

## 2. 一般现在时

**📝 定义：** 表示经常性、习惯性的动作或状态，也用于表示客观事实、真理和现在的状态。

**📋 结构：** 主语 + 动词原形（第三人称单数加-s/-es）

**💡 用法：**
- 表示经常性或习惯性动作：I get up at 6 every day.
- 表示客观事实或真理：The earth goes around the sun.
- 表示现在的状态或特征：She looks beautiful.
- 在时间/条件状语从句中表将来：If it rains tomorrow, I will stay at home.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~He go to school every day.~~ → ✅ **He goes to school every day.** (第三人称单数主语后，动词要加-s或-es)
- ❌ ~~She don't like apples.~~ → ✅ **She doesn't like apples.** (第三人称单数的否定用doesn't，不用don't)

**📌 例句：**
- I usually have breakfast at 7:00.
- She speaks English very well.
- Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius.

## 3. 一般过去时

**📝 定义：** 表示过去某一时间发生的动作或存在的状态，也表示过去经常或反复发生的动作。

**💡 用法：**
- 表示过去发生的动作：I visited my grandma yesterday.
- 表示过去存在的状态：He was a teacher ten years ago.
- 表示过去的习惯：When I was young, I often played football.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I go to Beijing last year.~~ → ✅ **I went to Beijing last year.** (有过去时间标志词（last year），动词要用过去式)
- ❌ ~~Did you went there?~~ → ✅ **Did you go there?** (did后面的动词要用原形)

**📌 例句：**

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I am very interesting in music.~~ → ✅ **I am very interested in music.** (人作主语时用-ed形式表示感受)

## 5. 现在完成时

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~The car was repair yesterday.~~ → ✅ **The car was repaired yesterday.** (be后面要用动词的过去分词)

- ❌ ~~He asked me that where I lived.~~ → ✅ **He asked me where I lived.** (特殊疑问词引导时不需要that)

- ❌ ~~This is the place where I visited.~~ → ✅ **This is the place which/that I visited.** (visit是及物动词，需要宾语，用which/that而非where)

**📌 例句：**

- The movie that we saw last night was exciting.
- I'll never forget the day when I graduated.

## 11. 主谓一致

**📝 定义：** 句子的主语和谓语动词在人称和数上要保持一致。

**📋 结构：** 单数主语 + 单数谓语 / 复数主语 + 复数谓语

**💡 用法：**
- 就近原则：There is/are..., Either...or..., Neither...nor..., Not only...but also...

- ❌ ~~Neither you nor he are right.~~ → ✅ **Neither you nor he is right.** (neither...nor...就近原则，he是单数，用is)
- ❌ ~~Maths are my favorite subject.~~ → ✅ **Maths is my favorite subject.** (学科名词（maths, physics, news等）虽以s结尾，但作单数)

**📌 例句：**
- Everyone is here.
- Not only he but also I am a student.

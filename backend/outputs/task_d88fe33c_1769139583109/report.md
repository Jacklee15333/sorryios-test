- ❌ ~~He runs more fast than me.~~ → ✅ **He runs faster than me.** (fast的比较级是faster，不是more fast)
- ❌ ~~This book is more better.~~ → ✅ **This book is better / much better.** (good的比较级是better，不能用more修饰)

**📌 例句：**
- My sister is two years older than me.
- This question is more difficult than that one.
- He works much harder than before.

## 30. 助动词do/does/did

**📝 定义：** 帮助构成疑问句和否定句

**📋 结构：** do/does/did + 动词原形

**💡 用法：**

- did用于过去时

**📌 例句：**
- Does she agree?
- Did you finish?

## 31. 动词

**📝 定义：** 动词

**📋 结构：** 动词

## 32. 名词单复数

**📝 定义：** 名词单复数

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~He can swims.~~ → ✅ **He can swim.** (情态动词后接动词原形，不加-s)
- ❌ ~~Must I finish it? — No, you mustn't.~~ → ✅ **Must I finish it? — No, you needn't/don't have to.** (must的否定回答用needn't或don't have to，mustn't表禁止)
- ❌ ~~He must be not at home.~~ → ✅ **He can't be at home.** (must be的否定是can't be，不是must not be)

**📌 例句：**

- You must hand in your homework on time.
- You should be more careful.

## 35. 状语从句

**📝 定义：** 在复合句中作状语的从句，用来修饰主句，表示时间、条件、原因、目的、结果、让步等。

**📋 结构：** 连词 + 从句，主句（从句可前可后）

- ❌ ~~Although he is tired, but he keeps working.~~ → ✅ **Although he is tired, he keeps working.** (although和but不能同时使用)
- ❌ ~~Because I was ill, so I didn't go to school.~~ → ✅ **Because I was ill, I didn't go to school.** (because和so不能同时使用)

**📌 例句：**
- I will call you as soon as I arrive.
- Unless you work hard, you won't succeed.
- He was so tired that he fell asleep immediately.

## 36. 并列句用and等连接词连接

**📝 定义：** 两个或多个并列的词、短语或完整句子需要用并列连词（and/but/or/so等）连接，表达并列、转折、选择、因果等关系。

**📋 结构：** clause 1 + conjunction + clause 2（如：..., and ...）

**💡 用法：**
- 连接两个并列的完整句子时，必须用并列连词或使用分号；不能只用逗号。
- and 表示并列/递进；but 表示转折；or 表示选择；so 表示结果/因此。
- 并列句中常见：相同主语可在第二分句省略（口语/写作需注意清晰）。

**📌 例句：**
- We should save energy, and we should plant more trees.
- He wanted to go, but it was raining.
- Do you want tea or coffee?

## 37. 逗号不能连接两句完整句子（comma splice）

**📝 定义：** Comma splice 指用逗号直接连接两句独立完整句（independent clauses），这是英语写作中的常见错误。

**📋 结构：** 错误：clause 1 , clause 2

**💡 用法：**
- 改法1：用并列连词：clause 1, and/but/so/or clause 2。
- 改法2：用分号：clause 1; clause 2。
- 改法3：拆成两个句子：clause 1. Clause 2。
- 改法4：把其中一句变成从句/短语（如 because/when/which 等）。

**📌 例句：**
- ❌ Protecting the environment is important, it makes our life better.
- ✅ Protecting the environment is important, and it makes our life better.
- ✅ Protecting the environment is important; it makes our life better.
- ✅ Protecting the environment is important. It makes our life better.

## 38. be动词的不同形式（am/is/are/was/were/been/being）

**📝 定义：** be 是最常用的系动词/助动词之一，会随人称、数、时态变化，用于系表结构、进行时、被动语态等。

**📋 结构：** am/is/are（一般现在）; was/were（一般过去）; been（过去分词）; being（现在分词）

**💡 用法：**
- 系表结构：be + adj./n.（He is happy.）
- 进行时：be + doing（They are studying.）
- 被动语态：be + 过去分词（The house is controlled by a system.）
- 完成时中的被动/进行组合：have been + done; am/is/are being + done。

**📌 例句：**
- I am a student.
- She was tired yesterday.
- The work has been finished.
- The door is being painted now.

## 39. 时态总览（一般/进行/完成/将来等）

**📝 定义：** 时态用于表示动作发生的时间与状态（是否正在进行、是否完成、是否将来等）。初中阶段重点掌握常见六大时态及其基本结构。

**📋 结构：** 一般现在：do/does; 一般过去：did; 一般将来：will + do / be going to + do; 现在进行：am/is/are + doing; 过去进行：was/were + doing; 现在完成：have/has + done

**💡 用法：**
- 一般现在：事实、习惯、规律（He plays basketball.）
- 一般过去：过去某时发生（He played yesterday.）
- 一般将来：将要发生（He will play tomorrow.）
- 进行时：某时正在发生（He is playing now.）
- 完成时：对现在有影响/经历/已完成（He has played before.）
- 时间状语词提示：now/yesterday/tomorrow/already/yet/since/for 等。

**📌 例句：**
- She goes to school every day.
- They were watching TV at 8 p.m. yesterday.
- I have already done my homework.
- We will visit the museum tomorrow.

## 40. do/does/did的选择规则（看原句动词时态与形式）

**📝 定义：** 当句子里没有 be/情态动词/助动词可提前时，一般疑问句与否定句需要借助 do/does/did。选择哪一个取决于原句的时态与主语人称数。

**📋 结构：** 一般疑问句：Do/Does/Did + 主语 + 动词原形...? 否定句：主语 + do/does/did + not + 动词原形

**💡 用法：**
- 一般现在：主语第三人称单数用 does；其他用 do。
- 一般过去：统一用 did。
- 用了 does/did 后，后面动词必须回到原形（doesn't make / didn't make）。
- 如果原句已有 be/情态动词（am/is/are/can/will等），不再用 do/does/did。

**📌 例句：**
- She likes apples. → Does she like apples? / She doesn't like apples.
- They grow vegetables. → Do they grow vegetables?
- He grew vegetables. → Did he grow vegetables?

## 41. 介词短语作地点/位置（on the top of）

**📝 定义：** 介词短语可以表示地点/位置/方向等，在句中常作状语或后置定语。

**📋 结构：** on/in/at/under/behind/... + 名词短语（如：on the top of the mountain）

**💡 用法：**
- 作状语：说明“在哪里/在什么位置”（They live on the top of the hill.）。
- 作后置定语：修饰前面的名词（the apples on the tree）。
- 注意固定搭配：on the top of（在……顶端/顶部）。

**📌 例句：**
- A flag is on the top of the building.
- The house on the top of the hill looks beautiful.
- Put the book on the desk.

## 42. 名词与动词拼写区别（bath/bathe；breath/breathe）

**📝 定义：** 有些词名词与动词拼写只差一个 e，含义与读音也会变化，考试中常考辨析。

**📋 结构：** bath（n.）→ bathe（v.）；breath（n.）→ breathe（v.)

**💡 用法：**
- bath：洗澡（名词）; bathe：洗澡/给……洗澡（动词）。
- breath：呼吸（名词，一口气）; breathe：呼吸（动词）。
- 做题时先判断词性：句子需要名词还是动词。

**📌 例句：**
- He takes a bath every night.
- He bathes the baby.
- Take a deep breath.
- Plants breathe through tiny openings.

## 43. 阅读题关键词定位法（题干关键词交叉定位）

**📝 定义：** 阅读理解中先读题干，圈出关键词，再到原文中寻找同义替换或相关信息，快速定位答案区域。

**📋 结构：** 题干关键词 → 原文定位 → 对比选项（找证据）

**💡 用法：**
- 优先圈名词/专有名词/数字/地点时间等稳定词（如 USA, Alice, 18）。
- 在原文中找同义表达或改写（spend = pay, entire = whole）。
- 定位到段落后，再精读附近几句确认细节。

**📌 例句：**
- Question: What does Jason do? → Keywords: Jason, do → Find “Jason” in the text → Read nearby sentences for evidence.

## 44. 阅读定位：两条信息交叉定位（答案在交叉点附近）

**📝 定义：** 当题干提供两个条件（如人物+时间/地点+行为）时，要在原文中找到两条信息的交叉位置，答案通常在交叉点附近。

**📋 结构：** 条件A定位范围 + 条件B定位范围 → 交叉区域精读

**💡 用法：**
- 先找更容易定位的词（人名/大写缩写/数字），再找第二条件（summer/at 8:00 等）。
- 交叉区域附近常出现同义替换：entire summer = whole summer。
- 不要只找到一个条件就选答案，必须两条都对上。

**📌 例句：**
- Alice + summer → Find “Alice” and “summer” → Answer is near where both appear.

## 45. 翻译方法：句子变长时找介词/连词，先处理修饰部分（从后往前翻）

**📝 定义：** 英语长句常因介词短语、从句、非谓语等修饰成分变长。翻译时可先抓介词/连词/从句边界，先翻修饰部分，再回到主干（主谓宾）。

**📋 结构：** 先主干（S-V-O）定位 → 标出介词/连词/从句 → 先翻修饰（常从后往前）→ 再整合成顺畅中文

**💡 用法：**
- 看到 for/to/in/from/with/without/that/which/when 等，先判断它们引导的结构。
- 先处理：地点/时间/原因/目的等修饰信息，再翻主干信息。
- 避免逐词硬翻，优先保证逻辑顺序清晰。

**📌 例句：**
- Proper preparation is essential for a successful experiment in science class.
- → 在科学课上，对一个成功的实验来说，合适的准备非常重要。

## 46. 句子成分：主谓宾（主语名词、谓语动词、宾语名词）

**📝 定义：** 英语基本句型常以主语+谓语+宾语（SVO）构成。判断句子成分有助于选词性、选时态、改写疑问句。

**📋 结构：** Subject（主语） + Verb（谓语） + Object（宾语）（可扩展补语/状语等）

**💡 用法：**
- 主语通常是名词/代词/动名词短语（Reading books...）。
- 谓语必须是动词并体现时态（make/makes/made）。
- 宾语通常是名词/代词/从句（teach people how to...）。

**📌 例句：**
- Reading books makes people smarter.
- The teacher teaches students English.
- I know that he is 18.

## 47. 备考策略：语法点反复抄写记忆

**📝 定义：** 通过“抄写+背诵+例句化”把常考结构（时态、被动、从句、疑问句等）形成自动反应，提高做题速度与稳定性。

**📋 结构：** 知识点标题 → 结构公式 → 2-3个例句 → 常错点提醒

**💡 用法：**
- 每天少量高频复习：时态结构、do/does/did、被动 be+done、宾语从句/定语从句。
- 每个知识点配固定例句，看到题目能直接套用。
- 复盘错题：把错因归类到对应语法点（例如 comma splice / 三单 / 介词后词性）。

**📌 例句：**
- 知识点：does + 动词原形；例句：Does he like it? / He doesn't like it.

## 48. 分词

**📝 定义：** 分词是动词的非谓语形式之一，包括现在分词（doing）与过去分词（done），可作定语、状语、补语等，也参与构成时态/语态。

**📋 结构：** 现在分词：V-ing；过去分词：V-ed/不规则（done/gone/eaten）

**💡 用法：**
- 现在分词作定语：a crying baby（正在哭的婴儿）。
- 过去分词作定语：an eaten apple（被吃过的苹果）。
- 进行时：be + doing；被动：be + done；完成时：have/has + done。

**📌 例句：**
- The boy standing there is Tom.
- The broken window was fixed.
- I have finished my work.

## 49. tense（时态）

**📝 定义：** 时态表示动作发生的时间与状态变化，是初中语法核心考点。

**📋 结构：** 根据不同时态选择动词形式（do/does/did/doing/done/will do等）

**💡 用法：**
- 看到时间标志词快速判断时态。
- 同一句中时态要与语境一致。
- 注意三单、否定与疑问的结构配套。

**📌 例句：**
- He studies every day. (一般现在)
- He is studying now. (现在进行)
- He has studied for two hours. (现在完成)

## 50. modal（情态动词）

**📝 定义：** 情态动词表达能力、可能、建议、义务等（can/may/must/should等），后面接动词原形。

**📋 结构：** modal + 动词原形；否定：modal + not + 动词原形

**💡 用法：**
- can：能力/允许；must：必须；should：建议；may：可能/允许。
- 情态动词提到句首可构成一般疑问句。
- 情态动词后不加 to，不加 -s，不加 -ed。

**📌 例句：**
- We should protect the environment.
- Can you help me?
- He must finish it today.

## 51. 从句

**📝 定义：** 从句是依附于主句的句子成分，常见有宾语从句、定语从句、状语从句。

**📋 结构：** 主句 + 连词/关系词 + 从句

**💡 用法：**
- 宾语从句：作宾语（I know that he is 18.）。
- 定语从句：修饰名词（families that are not rich）。
- 状语从句：表时间/原因/条件等（when/because/if...）。

**📌 例句：**

- 单数/不可数用 is；复数用 are。
- 一般疑问句：Is/Are there...? 否定：There isn't/aren't...
- 可搭配将来：There will be...
- 不能和 have 混用（there is ≠ have）。

**📌 例句：**

## 54. spend + 时间/钱 + (in) doing sth.

**📝 定义：** spend 表示“花费（时间/金钱）”，常用结构为 spend + 时间/钱 + (in) doing。

**📋 结构：** spend + 时间/钱 + (in) V-ing

**💡 用法：**
- in 常可省略：spend two hours reading。
- 主语通常是人；如果是物，常用 take/cost。
- 注意与 pay/cost/take 区分：pay 付钱；cost 花费（物作主语）；take 花费时间（it作形式主语）。

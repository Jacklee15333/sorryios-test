# 📖 语法知识

## 1. 介词 to 与 for：动作是否“到达/给到”对方

**📝 定义：** 表达“把某物给某人、某物到某人手上”常用 to；表达“为某人做某事/买东西（受益者）”常用 for。

**📋 结构：** give/pass/send + 物 + to + 人；buy/make + 物 + for + 人

**💡 用法：**
- I gave the book to him.（书交到他手上）
- I bought a book for him.（为他买书，强调受益者，不一定已交到他手上）
- 也可用 buy + 物 + and give it to + 人 来表达“买了并且给到了”

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I bought a book to you.~~ → ✅ **I bought a book for you. / I bought a book and gave it to you.** (buy 表“为某人买”通常搭配 for；to 更像“交付给”。)

**📌 例句：**
- This is important to everyone.
- I bought a book for you yesterday, and I gave it to you today.

## 2. 动名词作主语：Protecting the environment ...

**📝 定义：** 动词要作句子主语时，常用动名词（V-ing）把动作“名词化”，把它当作“一件事”。

**📋 结构：** V-ing + ... + 谓语动词 + ...

**💡 用法：**
- Protecting the environment becomes important.（“保护环境”这件事作主语）
- 动名词短语作主语时通常看作单数概念

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Protect the environment becomes important.~~ → ✅ **Protecting the environment becomes important.** (主语位置不能直接用动词原形表达“这件事”，要用动名词或不定式结构。)

**📌 例句：**
- Protecting the environment becomes more and more important.
- Saving energy is important to us.

## 3. 主谓一致：动名词短语作主语通常用单数谓语

**📝 定义：** 当主语是“Protecting the environment”这类动名词短语时，整体当作一件事，谓语动词用第三人称单数。

**📋 结构：** 动名词短语（单数概念） + becomes/is/has ...

**💡 用法：**
- Protecting the environment becomes ...（becomes加-s）
- If everyone does it, ...（everyone作主语也用单数does）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Protecting the environment become more important.~~ → ✅ **Protecting the environment becomes more important.** (主语是“这件事”，按单数处理。)

**📌 例句：**
- Protecting the environment becomes more and more important.
- Everyone does their part.

## 4. “越来越……”：more and more + 形容词

**📝 定义：** 表达程度逐渐增强，常用 more and more + 形容词（或比较级形式）。

**📋 结构：** be/become + more and more + adj.

**💡 用法：**
- more and more important（越来越重要）
- more and more serious（越来越严重）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~It becomes more important. (想表达越来越)~~ → ✅ **It becomes more and more important.** (more important通常表示“更重要（比较）”，不等于“越来越”。)

**📌 例句：**
- The environment is getting worse day by day.
- Protecting the environment becomes more and more important.

## 5. 避免逗号拼接（comma splice）：两句话需要连接词或分句结构

**📝 定义：** 英语里两个完整的独立句不能只用逗号连接；需要并列连词（and/but/so）或改为从句/分号等。

**📋 结构：** 句子A, and/but/so 句子B；或 句子A. 句子B.

**💡 用法：**
- We should protect the environment, and it can make our life better.
- We should protect the environment. It can make our life better.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~We should protect the environment, make our life better.~~ → ✅ **We should protect the environment, and it can make our life better.** (后半句缺主语且与前句只用逗号硬连，结构不完整。)

**📌 例句：**
- We can save energy, and we can also plant trees.
- First, we can save energy. Second, we can plant trees.

## 6. 句子必须有主语：必要时用 it 指代前文整件事

**📝 定义：** 英语句子里谓语动词通常需要明确主语；当指代前面“整件事/整段内容”可用 it 作形式主语或代词主语。

**📋 结构：** It + 谓语 + ...（it指代前文内容）

**💡 用法：**
- We should protect the environment, and it can make our life better.（it=保护环境这件事）
- If everyone does it, the environment will be better.（it=前面提到的做法）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Second, can also plant some trees.~~ → ✅ **Second, we can also plant some trees.** (缺少主语 we。)

**📌 例句：**
- It is important to everyone.
- It can make our life better.

## 7. when 引导时间状语从句：不用进行时乱入

**📝 定义：** 表达习惯性/一般情况时，when从句常用一般现在时；不要直接用“when + 主语 + going ...”这种缺少be动词的结构。

**📋 结构：** when + 主语 + 动词原形/三单, 主句 + ...

**💡 用法：**
- When we leave home, we turn off the light.
- When we go out, we can walk or ride a bike.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~When we going out, we choose walk.~~ → ✅ **When we go out, we choose to walk.** (going前缺少be；且一般情况用go out即可。)

**📌 例句：**
- When we leave home, we turn off the light.
- When we go out, we choose to walk.

## 8. 作文建议语气：should vs can

**📝 定义：** 提出倡议/建议时，should更有“应该”的力度；can更偏“能够/可以”，语气更客气、弱一些。

**📋 结构：** We should + 动词原形；We can + 动词原形

**💡 用法：**
- 强建议/号召：We should protect the environment.
- 举例/可行做法：For example, we can turn off the light.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~We can protect the environment. (整段在号召时一直用can)~~ → ✅ **We should protect the environment. For example, we can turn off the light.** (主张用should更符合“提倡”；举例措施再用can。)

**📌 例句：**
- We should protect the environment.
- For example, we can plant trees.

## 9. 代词指代一致：it / this / them

**📝 定义：** it 通常指代单个事物或前文“一件事”；them 指代复数名词；this 可指代“这一点/这件事（更贴近语境）”。

**📋 结构：** it=单数/一件事；them=复数名词；this=这一点/这件事

**💡 用法：**
- If everyone does it, the environment will be better.（it=某个做法/整件事）
- We planted some trees. Everyone should protect them.（them=trees）
- Everyone can do this.（this=这个做法/这件事）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Second... plant some trees... If everyone can do it, ... (上文有多个做法却只用it不清楚)~~ → ✅ **If everyone can do this, ... / If everyone can do them, ...** (上文若是多个措施或复数名词，要让代词指代更清晰。)

**📌 例句：**
- We can plant some trees to clean the air.
- If everyone can do this, the environment will be better.

## 10. 词汇辨析：tell / talk / speak（固定搭配与句型）

**📝 定义：** 这些动词含义相近但搭配不同：tell强调“告知”；talk强调“交谈/谈论”；speak强调“说话/讲某种语言/正式发言”。

**📋 结构：** tell sb to do sth；tell sb sth；tell sb (that) 从句；talk about sth；talk with/to sb；speak + 语言 / speak to sb（较正式）

**💡 用法：**
- tell sb to do：She told me to turn off the light.
- tell sb sth：He told me the news.
- tell (that) clause：He told me (that) he was busy.
- talk about：We talked about the environment.
- talk with/to：I talked with/to my teacher.
- speak English：He speaks English well.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~tell sb doing sth~~ → ✅ **tell sb to do sth / tell sb (that) ...** (tell后面表示“让某人去做”用to do；表示“告诉某事已发生”用that从句。)

**📌 例句：**
- She told me to plant trees.
- We talked about ways to save energy.
- He speaks English in class.

## 11. 强调句 It is/was ... that ...（写作加分句式）

**📝 定义：** 用 It is/was ... that ... 强调句子中的某一部分（主语/宾语/状语等），提升写作表达。

**📋 结构：** It is/was + 被强调部分 + that + 句子其余部分

**💡 用法：**
- 强调主语：It is protecting the environment that matters most.
- 强调时间：It is now that we should act.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~It is better for us that save energy.~~ → ✅ **It is better for us to save energy.** (It is + adj. + for sb + to do 为常用结构；强调句需要that并保留完整句子结构。)

**📌 例句：**
- It is the environment that we should protect.
- It is now that we must take action.

## 12. 词汇辨析：say vs speak（内容 vs 方式/语言）

**📝 定义：** say强调“说的内容”；speak强调“说话/交流的方式”或“讲某种语言”。

**📋 结构：** say (that) + 从句 / say + 内容；speak + 语言 / speak to/with + 人

**💡 用法：**
- say：He said it would rain.（他说：将要下雨——内容）
- speak：She can speak English.（她会用英语交流——语言/方式）
- 若强调把某个“单词”说出来，通常用 say：Say 'English'.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Speak it will rain.~~ → ✅ **Say (that) it will rain.** (表达“说的内容”要用say并用从句/内容承接。)
- ❌ ~~I speak English (想表达“英语这个词”).~~ → ✅ **I say 'English'.** (speak English表示“用英语说话”，不是“把English这个词念出来”。)

**📌 例句：**
- He said (that) it would rain.
- She speaks English and Chinese.

## 13. 词汇辨析：tell / talk / speak（常考固定搭配）

**📝 定义：** tell强调“告知/让某人去做”；talk强调“交谈/讨论”；speak更偏正式或强调语言/说话动作。

**📋 结构：** tell sb to do / tell sb sth / tell sb (that)...；talk about sth / talk with(to) sb；speak + language / speak to sb

**💡 用法：**
- tell sb to do：He told me to study.
- tell sb sth：She told me the truth.
- talk about：We talked about school.
- talk with/to：I talked with/to my friend.
- speak English：He speaks English well.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~tell sb doing sth~~ → ✅ **tell sb to do sth / tell sb (that) ...** (tell表示“让某人去做”用to do；表示“告诉发生了什么”用that从句。)

**📌 例句：**
- I need to talk to you.
- He told me to turn off the light.

## 14. 不规则动词变化与ABB/AAA分类（本段重点）

**📝 定义：** 部分动词不按-ed规则变化，需要记忆过去式和过去分词；有ABB（后两者相同）、AAA（三者相同）等类型。

**📋 结构：** 原形 - 过去式 - 过去分词（ABB/AAA等）

**💡 用法：**
- ABB：tell-told-told；say-said-said
- ABC：speak-spoke-spoken；do-did-done
- AAA：cut-cut-cut；put-put-put；read-read-read（读音变化）；hurt-hurt-hurt；spread-spread-spread；hit-hit-hit；cost-cost-cost

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~telled~~ → ✅ **told** (tell是不规则动词（ABB）。)
- ❌ ~~speaked~~ → ✅ **spoke / spoken** (speak是不规则动词（ABC）。)

**📌 例句：**
- He spoke to the class yesterday.
- I have spoken to him before.

## 15. 一般过去时：过去式的核心用法

**📝 定义：** 过去式用于描述“昨天/以前”发生并结束的动作或状态。

**📋 结构：** 主语 + 动词过去式 + 时间状语（yesterday/last week/...）

**💡 用法：**
- I ate rice yesterday.（过去已发生并结束）
- He said it would rain.（过去说过的话）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I eat rice yesterday.~~ → ✅ **I ate rice yesterday.** (yesterday提示一般过去时，动词要用过去式。)

**📌 例句：**
- I did my homework yesterday.
- She talked with me last night.

## 16. 过去分词的三大用法：完成 / 被动 / 形容词

**📝 定义：** 过去分词不仅用于完成时，还用于被动语态，并可像形容词一样修饰名词。

**📋 结构：** ① have/has + 过去分词；② be + 过去分词；③ 过去分词 + 名词

**💡 用法：**
- 完成：I have already done my homework.
- 被动：The apple is eaten by me.
- 形容词：the eaten apple（被吃的苹果）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I have did my homework.~~ → ✅ **I have done my homework.** (现在完成时要用过去分词done，不用过去式did。)

**📌 例句：**
- The house is controlled by a central system.
- She has spoken to the teacher.

## 17. 被动语态：be + 过去分词（by+动作执行者）

**📝 定义：** 当主语是动作的承受者时，用被动语态；需要be动词随时态变化。

**📋 结构：** 主语 + be(am/is/are/was/were/been/being) + 过去分词 (+ by + 人/物)

**💡 用法：**
- 一般现在时被动：The apple is eaten by me.
- 一般过去时被动：The apple was eaten by me.
- 完成时中的be：has/have been + 过去分词（如has been controlled）
- 进行时中的be：is/are being + 过去分词（如is being controlled）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~The house is control by a system.~~ → ✅ **The house is controlled by a system.** (be后必须接过去分词controlled。)

**📌 例句：**
- The house is controlled by a central system.
- The rules were explained by the teacher.

## 18. 拼写规则：重读闭音节/英式双写（planned, controlled）

**📝 定义：** 部分动词加-ed/-ing时需要双写末尾辅音；此外英式拼写中以-l结尾的动词常见双写l。

**📋 结构：** plan → planned/planning；control → controlled/controlling

**💡 用法：**
- plan：He planned the trip.
- control：The machine is controlled by a system.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~planed~~ → ✅ **planned** (plan为重读闭音节，末尾n需双写。)
- ❌ ~~controled~~ → ✅ **controlled** (常见写法为controlled（双写l）。)

**📌 例句：**
- They planned a new schedule.
- The room is controlled by a computer.

## 19. 作文选词：speech / speaker（名词意义不同）

**📝 定义：** speech是“演讲/讲话（内容/活动）”；speaker是“演讲者/说话者/扬声器（人或设备）”。

**📋 结构：** give/make a speech；the speaker + 谓语

**💡 用法：**
- I gave a speech in front of the crowd.
- The speaker was nervous.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I gave a speaker in front of the crowd.~~ → ✅ **I gave a speech in front of the crowd.** (“做演讲”用speech；speaker是人/设备，不是“演讲活动”。)

**📌 例句：**
- Giving a speech can make people nervous.
- The speaker prepared well.

## 20. 词汇辨析：experiment vs experience

**📝 定义：** experiment是“实验”；experience是“经历/经验”，词形相近但意义不同。

**📋 结构：** do an experiment；have experience in/with ...

**💡 用法：**
- We did an experiment in science class.
- She has experience with public speaking.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I have many experiment.~~ → ✅ **I have much experience. / I did many experiments.** (想表达“经验”用experience；“多次实验”用experiments（复数）。)

**📌 例句：**
- Proper preparation is essential for a successful experiment.
- He has rich experience.

## 21. 长句翻译技巧：抓介词/连词，从后往前译修饰成分

**📝 定义：** 英语长句通常因介词短语、连词结构变长；翻译时先找介词/连词引出的“附加信息”，再处理主干。

**📋 结构：** 主干（主谓宾） + 介词短语/从句等修饰；翻译可先译修饰：in..., for..., of..., with..., because...

**💡 用法：**
- 先找介词短语：in science class / for a successful experiment
- 再译主干：proper preparation is essential
- 组合：在科学课上/对于一个成功的实验来说，合适的准备是必不可少的。

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~合适的准备是重要的对于一个成功的实验在科学课上。~~ → ✅ **在科学课上，对于一个成功的实验来说，合适的准备非常重要。** (中文语序更自然：先交代背景（介词短语），再说核心判断。)

**📌 例句：**
- Proper preparation is essential for a successful experiment in science class.
- In science class, proper preparation is essential for a successful experiment.

## 22. 动名词作主语：V-ing整体作主语（不是介词短语作主语）

**📝 定义：** 动词加-ing可名词化，作为一句话的主语；主语通常是“动名词短语整体”。

**📋 结构：** V-ing + 宾语/状语（整体） + 谓语

**💡 用法：**
- Giving a speech can make people nervous.（做演讲这件事作主语）
- 动名词短语整体看作“单数概念”时，谓语用单数

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~In front of a crowd give a speech is nervous.~~ → ✅ **Giving a speech in front of a crowd can be nervous.** (主语应是动名词短语（Giving a speech...），介词短语通常作修饰。)

**📌 例句：**
- Giving a speech is difficult for some people.
- Preparing well is essential.

## 23. 介词后接什么：介词 + 名词/动名词（不是动词原形）

**📝 定义：** 介词后面通常接名词或动名词；不能直接接动词原形。

**📋 结构：** prep. + n. / prep. + V-ing

**💡 用法：**
- without + V-ing：without saying goodbye
- into + n.：into management
- in + n.：in class

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~into manage~~ → ✅ **into management** (into是介词，后面要接名词。)
- ❌ ~~without say goodbye~~ → ✅ **without saying goodbye** (without后可接动名词saying。)

**📌 例句：**
- She walked into the room without knocking.
- More women should enter into management.

## 24. 不定式 to do：两词当作一个整体（常用于目的/要求/评价）

**📝 定义：** to do 是“不定式结构”，整体可作名词性/目的性成分；与动名词一样都属于“结构变化”。

**📋 结构：** to + 动词原形（整体）

**💡 用法：**
- It is surprising to see him speak so fluently.
- invite/ask + sb + to do

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~invite somebody doing something~~ → ✅ **invite somebody to do something** (invite表示“邀请去做（尚未发生）”，固定搭配to do。)

**📌 例句：**
- They invited me to join the club.
- The teacher asked us to be quiet.

## 25. It is 强调句 vs It is + adj. + to do（本段出现两种It is结构）

**📝 定义：** It is...that...用于强调；It is + adj. + to do用于评价/感受（如surprising/essential）。两者结构不同。

**📋 结构：** 强调句：It is/was + 被强调部分 + that + 句子其余部分,评价句：It is + adj. + to do sth / It is + adj. + for sb + to do sth

**💡 用法：**
- 评价：It is surprising to see such a little boy speak so fluently.
- 强调：It is a foreign language that he speaks fluently.（强调宾语/内容）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~It is surprising that to see him...~~ → ✅ **It is surprising to see him...** (to do结构不需要that；若用that应改为从句：It is surprising that he can...)

**📌 例句：**
- It is essential for students to prepare well.
- It is John that I met yesterday.

## 26. see 的两种宾补：see sb do vs see sb doing

**📝 定义：** see sb do 强调动作完整发生（从头到尾/事实）；see sb doing 强调“正在发生”的动作片段。

**📋 结构：** see + 宾语 + do / doing

**💡 用法：**
- see sb do：I saw him speak to the crowd.（看见他做了这件事）
- see sb doing：I saw him speaking to the crowd.（看见他当时正在说）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I saw him to speak.~~ → ✅ **I saw him speak / I saw him speaking.** (see作感官动词，宾补不用to（主动语态）。)

**📌 例句：**
- I saw her cross the street.
- I saw her crossing the street.

## 27. invite/ask 的固定搭配：只能接 to do（表示尚未发生的动作）

**📝 定义：** invite/ask表示“邀请/要求某人去做”，通常动作未发生，因此用to do而不用doing。

**📋 结构：** invite/ask + sb + to do sth

**💡 用法：**
- invite：They invited him to give a speech.
- ask：Ms. Liu asked us to be quiet.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~ask somebody doing something~~ → ✅ **ask somebody to do something** (ask在此义项固定搭配to do。)

**📌 例句：**
- The teacher asked us to answer the question.
- They invited us to share ideas on the website.

## 28. 称呼语用法：Mr. / Mrs. / Miss / Ms.

**📝 定义：** Mr.用于男性；Mrs.用于已婚女性；Miss用于未婚女性；Ms.用于不确定或不强调婚姻状况的女性。

**📋 结构：** 称呼 + 姓氏（如Ms. Liu / Mr. Lee）

**💡 用法：**
- Mr. Lee（男老师/男士）
- Mrs. Smith（已婚女士）
- Miss Liu（未婚女士/女老师）
- Ms. Liu（不确定/不想说明婚姻状况）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Mister Liu (用于女性)~~ → ✅ **Miss/Ms./Mrs. Liu** (Mr.只用于男性；女性需用Miss/Ms./Mrs.。)

**📌 例句：**
- Ms. Brown asked us to be quiet.
- Mr. Wang is our math teacher.

## 29. to do vs to doing：不定式后永远用动词原形

**📝 定义：** to do结构里to后必须接动词原形；to doing通常不成立（除非to是介词，如look forward to doing）。

**📋 结构：** to + 动词原形

**💡 用法：**
- invite/ask + sb + to do：invite him to come / ask us to be quiet
- It is + adj. + to do：It is important to study

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~invite him to coming~~ → ✅ **invite him to come** (不定式to后接原形come。)
- ❌ ~~ask us to being quiet~~ → ✅ **ask us to be quiet** (to后接原形be。)

**📌 例句：**
- They invited me to join the club.
- It is useful to learn grammar.

## 30. 介词后接名词或动名词：without + n./doing

**📝 定义：** 介词后不能直接接动词原形；要接名词或动名词（V-ing）。

**📋 结构：** preposition + noun / preposition + V-ing

**💡 用法：**
- without + 名词：without money
- without + V-ing：without saying anything

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~without say anything~~ → ✅ **without saying anything** (without是介词，后接动名词saying。)

**📌 例句：**
- He left without saying goodbye.
- She went out without an umbrella.

## 31. 一般疑问句改写：有be/情态/助动词就提前；没有就用do/does/did

**📝 定义：** 把陈述句变一般疑问句：先看句中是否有be动词、情态动词或助动词（如have/has用于完成时）；有就把它提前；没有就在句首加do/does/did，动词变回原形。

**📋 结构：** ① be/情态/助动词 + 主语 + ... ?,② Do/Does/Did + 主语 + 动词原形 + ... ?

**💡 用法：**
- be：He is a student. → Is he a student?
- 情态：She can swim. → Can she swim?
- 完成时：They have finished. → Have they finished?
- 无上述：He makes cakes. → Does he make cakes?

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Does he makes cakes?~~ → ✅ **Does he make cakes?** (用了does后，实义动词要回原形make。)
- ❌ ~~Do he make cakes?~~ → ✅ **Does he make cakes?** (主语为三单he，用does。)

**📌 例句：**
- Do you like apples?
- Did she go to school yesterday?

## 32. 助动词do/does/did的选择：看时态与主语（三单/非三单）

**📝 定义：** 一般现在时：主语是第三人称单数用does，否则用do；一般过去时用did。选择时也可看原句动词形式：三单-s→does；过去式→did；原形/非三单→do。

**📋 结构：** 现在：do/does + 原形；过去：did + 原形

**💡 用法：**
- He makes... → Does he make...?
- They make... → Do they make...?
- He made... → Did he make...?

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Do he makes ... ?~~ → ✅ **Does he make ... ?** (he是第三人称单数，用does；动词回原形。)

**📌 例句：**
- Does the oven tell us something?
- Do they share ideas online?

## 33. 特殊疑问句（划线部分提问）：WH词 + 一般疑问句语序

**📝 定义：** 对划线部分提问：先确定问什么（人/物/时间/地点/原因等）选择WH词；再把剩下部分变成一般疑问句语序（有助动词就提前，没有就加do/does/did）。

**📋 结构：** WH-word + 助动词/系动词/情态 + 主语 + 动词原形 + ... ?

**💡 用法：**
- 对物：What does the oven tell us?
- 对人：Who does the teacher ask to be quiet?
- 对时间：When do we eat dinner?

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~What the oven tells us?~~ → ✅ **What does the oven tell us?** (特殊疑问句也需要倒装/助动词结构。)

**📌 例句：**
- What does the oven tell us?
- Where do they share their ideas?

## 34. 宾语从句的概念：作宾语的“句子”

**📝 定义：** 宾语从句就是在句子中充当宾语的从句（做宾语的句子）。常见于tell/know/think/ask等动词后面。

**📋 结构：** 主句动词 + (that/wh-) + 从句

**💡 用法：**
- He tells us (that) it is ready.
- The oven tells us what to do.（也可视为含疑问词的宾语从句结构）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~He tells us to that it is ready.~~ → ✅ **He tells us (that) it is ready.** (that从句前不加to。)

**📌 例句：**
- She knows what he wants.
- He told me (that) he was busy.

## 35. 第三人称单数（三单）：不是“三个单”，是“第三人称 + 单数”

**📝 定义：** 三单=第三人称单数（he/she/it/单数名词）；一般现在时动词常加-s/-es。I/you不属于三单。

**📋 结构：** he/she/it/单数名词 + 动词-s/-es

**💡 用法：**
- He likes... / She goes... / The oven tells...
- They like...（复数不加-s）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I does~~ → ✅ **I do** (I是第一人称，不用does。)
- ❌ ~~They tells~~ → ✅ **They tell** (they是复数，不用三单-s。)

**📌 例句：**
- The oven tells us the time.
- He does his homework every day.

## 36. 一般疑问句的核心考点：无be/情态/助动词时用do/does/did

**📝 定义：** 改一般疑问句最常考的是：句中没有be动词、情态动词（can等）或助动词（have/has用于完成时）时，必须用do/does/did并把实义动词还原。

**📋 结构：** Do/Does/Did + 主语 + 动词原形 + ... ?

**💡 用法：**
- 原句动词原形/非三单：用do
- 原句动词三单-s：用does，且动词去-s变原形
- 原句动词过去式：用did，且动词变原形

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Does they make ... ?~~ → ✅ **Do they make ... ?** (they不是三单，用do。)
- ❌ ~~Did he made ... ?~~ → ✅ **Did he make ... ?** (did后动词必须回原形make。)

**📌 例句：**
- Do they grow vegetables here?
- Does the smart garden grow plants quickly?

## 37. 不规则动词发音与拼写：grow / grew / grown

**📝 定义：** grow属于不规则动词，过去式grew、过去分词grown；课堂强调读音容易混淆，要区分/ɡrəʊ/与/ɡruː/。

**📋 结构：** grow - grew - grown

**💡 用法：**
- 一般过去：The tree grew fast last year.
- 现在完成：The tree has grown taller.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~growed~~ → ✅ **grew** (grow是不规则动词，过去式是grew。)

**📌 例句：**
- He grew up in the countryside.
- The kids have grown a lot.

## 38. 合并句子：without + 动名词（把一句话名词化）

**📝 定义：** 用without合并两句时，without后不能接完整句子；通常把其中一句去主语、去助动词，把动词变V-ing变成名词性短语。

**📋 结构：** 主句 + without + V-ing + 宾语/状语

**💡 用法：**
- They can cook meals without wasting any food.
- He left without saying anything.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~They can cook meals without they waste food.~~ → ✅ **They can cook meals without wasting food.** (without后不能接“主语+谓语”的完整句，需用V-ing短语。)

**📌 例句：**
- The smart kitchen cooks meals without wasting food.
- She went out without taking an umbrella.

## 39. 合并句子：and连接并列分句（主语相同可省略）

**📝 定义：** and是连词，可以直接连接两句话；若前后分句主语相同，后一句的主语常可省略以避免重复。

**📋 结构：** (主语 + 谓语 + ...) and (省略主语) + 谓语 + ...

**💡 用法：**
- They can cook meals, and (they) never waste any food.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~They can cook meals and without wasting food.~~ → ✅ **They can cook meals without wasting food. / They can cook meals and never waste food.** (and连接分句；without引导介词结构，两种合并方式结构不同。)

**📌 例句：**
- She opened the door and walked in.
- He studied hard and got a good score.

## 40. 名词/动词同形与词性判断：volunteer（名词/动词）

**📝 定义：** 同一个单词可能既是名词也可作动词；判断词性要看句子成分（主语/谓语位置）。

**📋 结构：** volunteer (n.) / volunteer (v.)

**💡 用法：**
- 名词：Many volunteers came.
- 动词：Many students volunteer to help.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Young people in the USA volunteer.（当成名词翻译）~~ → ✅ **在该句中volunteer是动词：志愿去做……** (主语已有young people，后面出现volunteer更可能是谓语动词。)

**📌 例句：**
- They volunteer to help others.
- The volunteers worked all day.

## 41. spend的核心义：花费（时间/金钱）→ 语境决定是否译为“度过”

**📝 定义：** spend底层含义是“花费”；当宾语是时间并搭配活动时可译“花时间做……”，不一定都译成“度过”。

**📋 结构：** spend + 时间/金钱 + (on sth / doing sth)

**💡 用法：**
- spend time doing：spend time helping others
- spend money on：spend money on books

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~They spend time help others.~~ → ✅ **They spend time helping others.** (spend time后常接doing结构。)

**📌 例句：**
- He spends two hours reading every day.
- She spent a lot of money on the phone.

## 42. 名词加e变动词导致读音变化：bath/bathe, breath/breathe

**📝 定义：** 部分词对：名词无e，动词加e；读音也随之变化（常见考点）。

**📋 结构：** bath (n.) → bathe (v.)；breath (n.) → breathe (v.)

**💡 用法：**
- 名词：Take a bath. / Take a deep breath.
- 动词：He bathed the baby. / Try to breathe slowly.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I will bath now.（想表达动词）~~ → ✅ **I will bathe now.** (动词应为bathe而非bath。)
- ❌ ~~I can't breath well.~~ → ✅ **I can't breathe well.** (动词应为breathe而非breath。)

**📌 例句：**
- She took a bath and then breathed deeply.
- It's important to breathe fresh air.

## 43. 阅读题技巧：先读题干，抓名词关键词定位（交叉信息）

**📝 定义：** 做阅读时不一定通读全文；先读懂题目，抓题干里稳定的名词关键词（如USA, Alice, summer）去原文定位，信息交叉处通常就是答案区。

**📋 结构：** 题干关键词（名词/专有名词/时间地点）→ 原文定位 → 对照选项

**💡 用法：**
- 题干：young people in the USA + volunteer + help others → 定位USA/young people/volunteer所在段落
- 题干：Alice + summer → 同时满足两词的句子附近找答案

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~先把整篇文章逐句翻译再做题~~ → ✅ **先定位关键词再读相关句/段** (考试时间有限，定位法更高效。)

**📌 例句：**
- Find 'USA' and 'volunteer' in the passage, then read around that part.
- Cross-check 'Alice' + 'summer' to locate the exact sentence.

## 44. 阅读定位：两条信息交叉定位（交叉点附近就是答案区）

**📝 定义：** 题干往往给出两条线索（如人物+时间/地点）；先分别定位两条信息，再找它们在原文中的交叉区域，答案通常在交叉区域附近。

**📋 结构：** 线索A定位 + 线索B定位 → 交叉点（同一句/同一段）→ 对照选项

**💡 用法：**
- 人物+时间：Alice + summer
- 人物+行为：young people in the USA + volunteer

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~只找到人物就直接选答案~~ → ✅ **必须同时满足两条线索，找交叉点再选** (题干是“双条件”，只满足一个条件容易选错。)

**📌 例句：**
- Alice is here, and 'summer' is there—read around where they meet.
- USA + young people + volunteer—answers usually appear near that cluster.

## 45. 后置定语：修饰名词但放在名词后面（短语/从句都可以）

**📝 定义：** 后置定语就是放在名词后面的修饰成分，用来描述名词；常见形式有介词短语后置、定语从句后置。

**📋 结构：** 名词 + 介词短语：the apple on the tree,名词 + 定语从句：families that are not rich

**💡 用法：**
- 当修饰成分较长或是句子时，通常放在名词后面，避免歧义
- 单个形容词一般前置：a beautiful apple

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~on the tree apple~~ → ✅ **the apple on the tree** (介词短语作定语通常后置，前置会造成结构和意义混乱。)

**📌 例句：**
- the book on the desk
- the students who study hard

## 46. that的两种常见用法：宾语从句连接词 vs 定语从句关系代词

**📝 定义：** that放在句中间可能是：①引导宾语从句的连接词（不作成分）；②引导定语从句的关系代词（指代先行词并在从句中充当成分）。

**📋 结构：** 动词 + that + 句子：We know that Jason is 18.（宾语从句）,名词 + that + 句子：families that are not rich（定语从句）

**💡 用法：**
- 判断方法：看that前面的词——动词更像宾语从句；名词更像定语从句
- 定语从句中that修饰前面的名词（先行词）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~把所有that都当成同一种用法~~ → ✅ **先看that前面是名词还是动词，再判断从句类型** (宾语从句与定语从句功能不同，翻译和理解方式也不同。)

**📌 例句：**
- We believe that he is honest.
- The house that they built is cheap.

## 47. 定语从句识别：that从句紧跟名词，专门修饰最近的名词

**📝 定义：** 定语从句本质是“句子当定语”，通常紧跟被修饰名词；常遵循“就近修饰”，让指代更清晰。

**📋 结构：** 名词（先行词） + that/who/which + 从句

**💡 用法：**
- families that are not rich：that从句修饰families
- the apple that is on the tree：that从句修饰apple

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~让一个从句同时修饰两个名词~~ → ✅ **按就近原则只修饰一个明确的先行词** (修饰对象不明确会造成语义模糊。)

**📌 例句：**
- Students who work hard get good grades.
- People that help others are respected.

## 48. 宾语从句识别：that后是一整句，整体作宾语

**📝 定义：** 宾语从句是“句子当宾语”，出现在动词后，用来补全“知道/认为/说”的内容。

**📋 结构：** 主语 + 动词（know/think/say/tell等） + that + 从句

**💡 用法：**
- We know that Jason is 18.
- He said that he would come.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~We know Jason is 18 that.~~ → ✅ **We know that Jason is 18.** (that引导从句，位置应在动词后、从句前。)

**📌 例句：**
- I think that it is true.
- She knows that he is a teacher.

## 49. the + 形容词：表示“一类人”（作复数概念）

**📝 定义：** the + 形容词可表示某一类人（整体群体），如the rich（富人），the young（年轻人），the old（老人）。

**📋 结构：** the + adjective（复数意义）

**💡 用法：**
- the rich：富人（群体）
- the poor：穷人（群体）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~the rich is~~ → ✅ **the rich are** (the+形容词表示一类人，常用复数谓语are。)

**📌 例句：**
- The rich are not always happy.
- The young are full of energy.

## 50. 双宾语动词：teach + 间接宾语 + 直接宾语

**📝 定义：** teach可带两个宾语：教“某人”（间接宾语）+ 教“什么内容”（直接宾语）。对内容提问用what。

**📋 结构：** teach + sb + sth / teach + sb + how to do sth

**💡 用法：**
- He teaches people how to build houses.
- What does he teach people?

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~What he teaches people?~~ → ✅ **What does he teach people?** (特殊疑问句仍需助动词do/does倒装结构。)

**📌 例句：**
- She taught us English.
- He teaches students how to read.

## 51. 翻译技巧：什么时候需要“从后往前翻”

**📝 定义：** 当句子里出现介词短语、连词、从句等“增加成分”导致句子变长、难以一眼看懂时，可以先翻译后面的修饰成分（介词短语/从句），再回到主干翻译。

**📋 结构：** 先处理修饰成分（介词短语/从句）→ 再翻主干（主谓宾）→ 必要时加“的”连接

**💡 用法：**
- 有介词/连词/从句时：先翻修饰成分，再翻主句
- 句子短且无连接成分时：按正常语序翻译即可

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~所有句子都机械从后往前翻~~ → ✅ **只在句子复杂、修饰成分多时使用从后往前** (短句或纯主谓宾句不需要倒着翻。)

**📌 例句：**
- Kids with trouble in reading need help.（先翻with...）
- He teaches kids.（短句直接翻）

## 52. 后置定语是阅读难点的“罪魁祸首”：介词短语后置 + 定语从句后置

**📝 定义：** 阅读中大量后置定语会让句子变长、信息堆在名词后面；常见两种：介词短语作后置定语、定语从句作后置定语。

**📋 结构：** 名词 + 介词短语：the kids in trouble,名词 + 定语从句：kids who have trouble in reading

**💡 用法：**
- 看见名词后面跟一长串：先找被修饰的名词，再切分后置部分
- 先判断后置部分是短语还是句子：短语=介词短语；句子=从句

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~把后置定语当成疑问词或主句成分~~ → ✅ **把后置部分整体当作修饰语，先抓主干** (后置定语只修饰名词，不改变主干主谓宾。)

**📌 例句：**
- the families in the city
- the families that are not rich

## 53. that在句中：不要当疑问词，常是连词/关系代词引导从句

**📝 定义：** that在句中间通常不是疑问词；要么引导宾语从句（连词），要么引导定语从句（关系代词）。出现that后面往往是一整句。

**📋 结构：** 动词 + that + 句子（宾语从句）,名词 + that + 句子（定语从句）

**💡 用法：**
- 判断关键：that前面是动词→更可能宾语从句；that前面是名词→更可能定语从句
- 定语从句遵循就近修饰：修饰最近的名词

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~把that后面的句子当作主句继续翻~~ → ✅ **切分：主干 + 从句（修饰/补充内容）** (that后面是从句，不是新的并列主句。)

**📌 例句：**
- We know that he is right.
- The kid that has trouble in reading needs help.

## 54. 动名词作主语：reading books 是“一件事”，谓语用三单

**📝 定义：** 动词加-ing构成动名词/动名词短语，可当名词作主语；即使后面宾语是复数books，整个短语仍视为单数概念，谓语用三单。

**📋 结构：** V-ing (短语) + V-s

**💡 用法：**
- Reading books makes people better.
- Swimming is good for health.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Reading books make people better.~~ → ✅ **Reading books makes people better.** (reading books整体作主语=单数，谓语用makes。)
- ❌ ~~Read books makes people better.~~ → ✅ **Reading books makes people better.** (主语位置要用名词性形式：动名词reading。)

**📌 例句：**
- Reading helps you make progress.
- Doing exercise improves your health.

## 55. 主谓宾骨架：先抓主语，再决定谓语是否三单（不要被books误导）

**📝 定义：** 判断谓语是否加-s，关键看主语是什么（读书这件事/书本本身）；同一句汉语可用不同逻辑表达，但要保证主语与谓语一致。

**📋 结构：** 读书这件事：Reading books + makes ...,书本本身：Books + make ...

**💡 用法：**
- Reading books makes people better.（读书这件事）
- Books make people better.（书本带来的作用）

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~Reading books make...~~ → ✅ **Reading books makes...** (主语不是books，而是reading books。)

**📌 例句：**
- Reading English every day makes you better.
- Books make us wiser.

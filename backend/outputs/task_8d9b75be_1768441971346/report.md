# 📖 语法

## 1. 不定式 (to + 动词原形)

**📝 定义：** 由to + 动词原形构成的非谓语动词形式，可以作主语、宾语、表语、定语、状语和宾语补足语。

**📋 结构：** to + 动词原形

**💡 用法：**
- 作宾语：I want to go home. / I decide to study hard.
- 作目的状语：I came here to see you.
- 作主语：To learn English well is important. = It is important to learn English well.
- 作宾语补足语：My mother asked me to clean the room.
- 作定语：I have something to tell you.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I want go home.~~ → ✅ **I want to go home.** (want后接不定式，必须有to)
- ❌ ~~He made me to cry.~~ → ✅ **He made me cry.** (make/let/have等使役动词后用省略to的不定式)
- ❌ ~~I saw him to run.~~ → ✅ **I saw him run/running.** (感官动词see/hear/watch后用省略to的不定式或-ing)

**📌 例句：**
- She decided to become a doctor.
- It's kind of you to help me.
- I don't know what to do.

## 2. 一般现在时

**💡 用法：**
- 表示经常性或习惯性动作：I get up at 6 every day.
- 表示客观事实或真理：The earth goes around the sun.
- 表示现在的状态或特征：She looks beautiful.
- 在时间/条件状语从句中表将来：If it rains tomorrow, I will stay at home.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~He go to school every day.~~ → ✅ **He goes to school every day.** (第三人称单数主语后，动词要加-s或-es)
- ❌ ~~She don't like apples.~~ → ✅ **She doesn't like apples.** (第三人称单数的否定用doesn't，不用don't)

**📌 例句：**
- I usually have breakfast at 7:00.

- Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius.

## 3. 一般过去时

**📝 定义：** 表示过去某一时间发生的动作或存在的状态，也表示过去经常或反复发生的动作。

- 表示过去存在的状态：He was a teacher ten years ago.
- 表示过去的习惯：When I was young, I often played football.

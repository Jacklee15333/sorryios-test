# 📖 语法

## 1. 情态动词

**📝 定义：** 表示说话人的语气或态度的动词，后接动词原形，没有人称和数的变化。

**📋 结构：** 主语 + 情态动词 + 动词原形

**💡 用法：**
- can/could 表能力、许可、可能：I can swim. / Could you help me?
- may/might 表许可、可能：May I come in? / It may rain.
- must 表必须、肯定推测：You must finish it. / He must be at home.
- should 表应该、建议：You should study hard.
- need 表需要（否定needn't）：You needn't worry.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~He can swims.~~ → ✅ **He can swim.** (情态动词后接动词原形，不加-s)
- ❌ ~~Must I finish it? — No, you mustn't.~~ → ✅ **Must I finish it? — No, you needn't/don't have to.** (must的否定回答用needn't或don't have to，mustn't表禁止)
- ❌ ~~He must be not at home.~~ → ✅ **He can't be at home.** (must be的否定是can't be，不是must not be)

**📌 例句：**
- Can you speak Japanese?
- You must hand in your homework on time.
- You should be more careful.

## 2. 定语从句

**📝 定义：** 在复合句中修饰名词或代词的从句，通常紧跟在被修饰的词（先行词）之后。

**📋 结构：** 先行词 + 关系词(who/which/that/whose/where/when) + 从句

**💡 用法：**
- who/that指人：The man who/that is talking is my father.
- which/that指物：The book which/that I bought is interesting.
- whose表所属：The girl whose mother is a doctor is my friend.
- where指地点：This is the school where I studied.
- when指时间：I still remember the day when I met you.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~The man which is talking is my teacher.~~ → ✅ **The man who/that is talking is my teacher.** (先行词是人时，用who或that，不用which)
- ❌ ~~The book who I bought is good.~~ → ✅ **The book which/that I bought is good.** (先行词是物时，用which或that，不用who)
- ❌ ~~This is the place where I visited.~~ → ✅ **This is the place which/that I visited.** (visit是及物动词，需要宾语，用which/that而非where)

**📌 例句：**
- I have a friend who can speak five languages.
- The movie that we saw last night was exciting.
- I'll never forget the day when I graduated.

## 3. 形容词/副词比较级

**📝 定义：** 用于两者之间的比较，表示'更...'的意思。

**📋 结构：** 形容词/副词比较级 + than / more + 形容词/副词原级 + than

**💡 用法：**
- 单音节和部分双音节词：加-er（tall→taller, big→bigger）
- 多音节和部分双音节词：more + 原级（beautiful→more beautiful）
- 不规则变化：good/well→better, bad/badly→worse, many/much→more
- 比较级的修饰词：much, a lot, even, still, a little

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~She is more taller than me.~~ → ✅ **She is taller than me.** (tall是单音节词，用-er形式，不需要more)
- ❌ ~~He runs more fast than me.~~ → ✅ **He runs faster than me.** (fast的比较级是faster，不是more fast)
- ❌ ~~This book is more better.~~ → ✅ **This book is better / much better.** (good的比较级是better，不能用more修饰)

**📌 例句：**
- My sister is two years older than me.
- This question is more difficult than that one.
- He works much harder than before.

## 4. 现在分词 (v. -ing作形容词/副词)

**📝 定义：** 由动词-ing形式构成，可以作定语、状语、表语和宾语补足语，表示主动或正在进行。

**💡 用法：**
- 作定语（表主动/进行）：the sleeping baby = the baby who is sleeping
- 作状语：Hearing the news, she jumped with joy.
- 作表语：The movie is exciting.
- 作宾语补足语：I saw him running.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~The news is excited.~~ → ✅ **The news is exciting.** (修饰物用-ing（令人...的），修饰人用-ed（感到...的）)

- 表示过去发生的动作：I visited my grandma yesterday.
- 表示过去存在的状态：He was a teacher ten years ago.
- 表示过去的习惯：When I was young, I often played football.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I go to Beijing last year.~~ → ✅ **I went to Beijing last year.** (有过去时间标志词（last year），动词要用过去式)

**📌 例句：**

## 6. 现在完成时

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I have see the movie.~~ → ✅ **I have seen the movie.** (have/has后面要用动词的过去分词形式)
- ❌ ~~I have bought this book yesterday.~~ → ✅ **I bought this book yesterday.** (有具体过去时间（yesterday），不能用现在完成时)
- ❌ ~~He has gone to Beijing for 3 days.~~ → ✅ **He has been in Beijing for 3 days.** (have gone表示去了还没回来，不能与for连用)

**📌 例句：**

## 7. 被动语态

**📝 定义：** 当主语是动作的承受者时，使用被动语态。强调动作的承受者或动作本身。

- 各种时态的被动：is done, was done, will be done, has been done等

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~The car was repair yesterday.~~ → ✅ **The car was repaired yesterday.** (be后面要用动词的过去分词)
- ❌ ~~The book is belonged to me.~~ → ✅ **The book belongs to me.** (belong是不及物动词，没有被动语态)

- ❌ ~~Maths are my favorite subject.~~ → ✅ **Maths is my favorite subject.** (学科名词（maths, physics, news等）虽以s结尾，但作单数)

**📌 例句：**

# 📖 语法

## 1. 形容词/副词比较级

**📝 定义：** 用于两者之间的比较，表示'更...'的意思。

**📋 结构：** 形容词/副词比较级 + than / more + 形容词/副词原级 + than

**💡 用法：**
- 单音节和部分双音节词：加-er（tall→taller, big→bigger）
- 多音节和部分双音节词：more + 原级（beautiful→more beautiful）
- 不规则变化：good/well→better, bad/badly→worse, many/much→more
- 比较级的修饰词：much, a lot, even, still, a little

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~She is more taller than me.~~ → ✅ **She is taller than me.** (tall是单音节词，用-er形式，不需要more)
- ❌ ~~He runs more fast than me.~~ → ✅ **He runs faster than me.** (fast的比较级是faster，不是more fast)
- ❌ ~~This book is more better.~~ → ✅ **This book is better / much better.** (good的比较级是better，不能用more修饰)

**📌 例句：**
- My sister is two years older than me.
- This question is more difficult than that one.
- He works much harder than before.

## 2. 构词法

- speak：说某种语言，演讲，speak English, speak to sb.
- talk：交谈，talk to/with sb., talk about sth.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~He said me the news.~~ → ✅ **He told me the news.** (tell后可直接接双宾语，say不可以)
- ❌ ~~Can you tell English?~~ → ✅ **Can you speak English?** (说某种语言用speak)
- ❌ ~~I want to say with you.~~ → ✅ **I want to talk with you.** (与某人交谈用talk with)

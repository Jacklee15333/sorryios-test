- 作宾语补足语：My mother asked me to clean the room.
- 作定语：I have something to tell you.

**⚠️ 易错点：**
- ❌ ~~I want go home.~~ → ✅ **I want to go home.** (want后接不定式，必须有to)
- ❌ ~~He made me to cry.~~ → ✅ **He made me cry.** (make/let/have等使役动词后用省略to的不定式)
- ❌ ~~I saw him to run.~~ → ✅ **I saw him run/running.** (感官动词see/hear/watch后用省略to的不定式或-ing)

**📌 例句：**

## 3. 现在完成时
